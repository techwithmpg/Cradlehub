# 📜 CHANGELOG — What Has Been Done

## 2026-07-22 - Codex (NOTIFICATIONS-001)

**Realtime:** Replaced minute notification polling with authenticated Supabase
Realtime reconciliation over existing `workspace_notifications`. Fresh rows
update the bell immediately, one visible tab claims each toast/chime, and
five-minute plus visibility/reconnect reconciliation covers missed events.

**Browser push:** Added opt-in own-row subscriptions, authenticated same-origin
APIs, server-only VAPID configuration, a bounded safe service worker, exact
role/branch/staff targeting, endpoint health/deactivation, Owner booking delivery
preferences, and explicit enable/test/disable settings. No automatic permission
request or second notification history was introduced.

**Booking coverage:** Pending online bookings alert CRM only. Staff and Driver
assignment delivery begins after payment confirmation; paid reassignment,
reschedule, and cancellation target the exact affected recipients. Push is
best-effort after durable persistence and cannot fail a booking.

**Evidence:** Type-check, Next production build, 161 files / 1,180 tests, lint
with one unrelated existing Attendance warning, and task diff checks pass. The
additive migration is intentionally unapplied; production VAPID setup and
browser/device QA remain. See `docs/operations/BROWSER_PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS.md`.

## 2026-07-22 - Codex (CRM-RETENTION-001)

**Changed:** Added an authenticated user/role/branch-scoped retained workspace
host using React Activity, canonical Next links/history, predictive reveal,
scroll restoration, a bounded LRU (CRM 4, Owner 3), identity-prefixed SWR keys,
and an unmounted restoration ledger that survives visual instance eviction.

**Rollout:** CRM Work Queue, Bookings, Schedule, Attendance, and Customers are
enabled by the CRM-first default. Owner Overview, Reports, and Bookings are
available with the `all` flag. `off` is the immediate rollback. Dispatch and
Owner Schedule are deliberately excluded from full retained DOM.

**Lifecycle:** Hidden frames are inert and inaccessible, and Activity cleans
their Effects so existing polling/timers/Realtime stop. Dirty/stale SWR modules
reconcile once on activation while current content remains. Existing booking
events mark related modules dirty; no route refresh or second data event bus was
added. Unsaved booking-note drafts block eviction and show a sidebar marker.

**Evidence:** Authenticated CRM QA passed same/evicted returns, canonical query
state, Back/Forward, inert hidden frames, four-frame LRU, and zero bootstrap
skeleton on cached remount. Type-check, build, 152 files / 1,152 tests, and lint
with one pre-existing warning pass. Owner and exact browser performance-panel
evidence remain pending; see `docs/performance/CRM-RETENTION-001-REPORT.md`.

## 2026-07-21 - Codex (CRM-PERF-002)

**Changed:** Migrated the active CRM and Owner workspaces to a persistent interaction architecture. Removed all 22 CRM/Owner route-level loading boundaries, made root authenticated loading non-visual, added stable shell markers and non-shifting link pending feedback, eliminated five internal document navigations, and de-duplicated workspace route prefetching.

**Retained data:** Owner Reports, Owner Bookings, Attendance, Dispatch, and Owner/Manager Schedule now retain server fallback data in SWR and reconcile only their scoped cache. CRM Schedule, Setup, Services, and Staff use history-backed subviews and preserve mounted state. Report charts stay visible while validating; Attendance/Dispatch realtime no longer refreshes the route tree.

**Mutations:** Services, provider assignments, staff edits/status/capabilities/branch issues, bookings/payments/dispatch, Owner Marketing, Attendance Rules, and Payroll reconcile optimistic or canonical action results locally. Repository `router.refresh()` calls fell from 74 to 26; active CRM/Owner routine mutation calls are zero. The remaining calls are auth/out-of-scope or seven inert legacy Availability calls.

**Verification:** Type check, production build (110 routes), diff check, focused interaction tests, and the complete 145-file / 1,117-test suite pass. Lint has no errors and two unrelated existing warnings. Authenticated CRM browser QA confirmed shell persistence, Schedule Back/Forward, retained Setup selection, and no console errors. Authenticated Owner browser QA remains release evidence; details are in `docs/performance/crm-perf-002-report.md`.

## 2026-07-15 - Codex (ATTENDANCE-BRANCH-RESOLUTION-TRANSACTION-FIX-003)

**Fixed:** Captured live SQLSTATE `42702` in
`resolve_staff_branch_correction_transaction(...)`: its two final
`attendance_exceptions` predicates referenced the resolver output parameter
`scan_event_id` ambiguously. Additive migration `20260715113001` qualifies those
table columns without changing the function signature, return contract, invoker
security, locks, atomicity, or service-only ACL.

**First-login repair:** Authenticated new phones are registered before canonical
wrong-branch evaluation, so future correction source events retain a verified
device ID without granting branch authority. Existing incomplete source events
return an explicit safe rescan instruction; the supplied real request remains
pending and untouched.

**Verification:** Linked rollback-only QA passed shift/day/permanent resolution,
second-manager replay, controlled missing-device handling, and forced rollback,
with zero synthetic residue. Types, 138 files / 1,103 tests, type-check, build,
live schema verification, and diff checks pass; lint has no errors and one
pre-existing warning. Authenticated production browser/device QA remains the
only conditional release evidence.

## 2026-07-15 - Codex (ATTENDANCE-BRANCH-CORRECTION-RESOLUTION-001)

**Changed:** Replaced ambiguous Branch Corrections approval with explicit
temporary shift/day access, permanent branch transfer, or scan rejection. An
approved request now resumes its stored wrong-branch scan through the existing
Attendance classification/commit engine; staff do not scan twice.

**Database:** Added bounded branch authorization, decision/continuation/result
links, historical home/actual branch snapshots, locks, replay protection,
service-role-only resolution, and read-only browser exposure in migration
`20260715113000_attendance_branch_correction_resolution.sql`. The isolated
migration is live and its exact version is recorded.

**Operations:** Permanent transfer changes current staff authority only and
creates audit plus targeted review work; rejection creates no Attendance.
Arbitrary date ranges remain deliberately deferred. See
`docs/attendance/BRANCH_CORRECTION_RESOLUTION.md`.

**Verification:** type-check and build pass; lint exits zero with one existing
warning; focused 5 files / 23 tests and full 136 files / 1,086 tests pass.
Rollback-only synthetic database QA left zero QA rows and did not touch real
staff Attendance.

## 2026-07-15 - Codex (CRM-OPEN-CLOSE-SCHEDULE-NORMALIZATION-001)

- Added a targeted Adjust Schedule repair for eligible CRM/CSR/front-desk staff
  with one overlapping Opening and one Closing window. The explicit automatic
  fix moves only the Opening end to the Closing start and preserves both labels,
  the Closing time, its next-day boundary, and ordered weekly persistence.
- Weekly totals and duration-fit checks now use unique merged coverage. The live
  Wed-Sat 10:00-19:30 plus 17:00-01:30 fixture displays 62h before repair and
  remains 62h after becoming adjacent; exact handoffs are continuous and real
  split-shift gaps remain unavailable.
- Resolver and Attendance integration preserve Opening responsibility before
  17:00, Closing responsibility after handoff/after midnight, and the intended
  business date without weakening global overlap validation.
- No migration or booking mutation was needed. Authenticated localhost QA saved
  and reopened Nikki Jumiller's repaired schedule successfully; the refreshed
  timeline showed continuous 10:00-01:30 coverage and zero conflicts.
- Verification passed: 93 focused tests, 135 files / 1,075 full tests,
  type-check, lint with one pre-existing warning, diff check, and the Next.js
  16.2.4 production build with 110 routes.

## 2026-07-15 - Codex (ATTENDANCE-SMART-DYNAMIC-CLOCK-OUT-001)

- Extended the existing Attendance engine with one restricted, schedule-backed
  dynamic resolver. Service providers use their own final service, CRM Closing
  uses the branch final in-spa service, home therapists use the final completed
  home service/dispatch, drivers use the final trip, and schedule end remains
  the no-work fallback.
- Added configurable service cleanup, home wrap-up, driver return, final-client
  release, and closing-portal category rules. Dynamic evidence and due windows
  persist on the existing Attendance row; QR recalculates before classification
  and preserves record-first/flag-second behavior.
- Added a zero-argument Staff Portal action and compact Staff/Driver Portal UI.
  The server resolves auth, tenant/staff identity, branch, open Attendance,
  registered HttpOnly device, remaining assignments, policy, and clock-out
  method. Ordinary staff remain on branch QR.
- Added focused booking/schedule/category event triggers under the same advisory
  lock used by QR/portal commits. The existing four Supabase safety stages still
  use stored dynamic deadlines; `vercel.json` has no frequent Attendance cron.
- Applied only additive migration
  `20260715021703_attendance_smart_dynamic_clock_out.sql` to the linked project,
  regenerated live types, and verified an idempotent Training Mode resolver
  probe without submitting a real staff clock-out. Migration-history drift is
  still 81 local-only / 5 remote-only, so no broad push/history repair occurred.
- Added the operations/upgrade guide and all 59 required contracts. Final gates
  pass: type-check; lint (one pre-existing warning); 134 files / 1,062 tests;
  additive/secret/config checks; linked live health verification; and a Next.js
  16.2.4 production build with 110 routes. Commit `5b0ce6cb` deployed READY on
  Vercel production; the public domain returned 200 and Staff Portal safely
  resolved to sign-in. Authenticated physical-device E2E is not claimed.

## 2026-07-15 - Codex (ATTENDANCE-HYBRID-CLOSING-AUTOMATION-001)

- Replaced the blocked five-minute Vercel Attendance cron with four exact direct
  SQL Supabase Cron jobs while retaining the unrelated daily agent job.
- Added one restricted, idempotent, bounded PostgreSQL processor for reminder,
  manager escalation, provisional auto-close, and ordered catch-up, plus three
  partial indexes containing only open live CRM closing rows.
- Moved notification/workflow-task delivery into the same authoritative database
  transaction and converted the legacy processor into a compatibility wrapper.
- Kept event-driven deadline snapshots at clock-in and added event-driven signal
  resolution after normal clock-out; no intervention rows are pre-created.
- Applied the isolated migration to the linked project, enabled pg_cron 1.6.4,
  and verified two active Asia/Manila branches, UTC database time, function ACLs,
  indexes, exactly four active jobs, three successful temporary QA cron runs, QA
  cleanup, and zero verification intervention/signal writes.
- Added the operations runbook and 40 focused hybrid automation contracts.
  Focused tests (93), full tests (133 files / 1002 tests), type-check, lint,
  linked database lint, and the Next.js production build pass.

## 2026-07-15 - Codex (LIVE-DATABASE-UI-VERIFICATION-CONNECTION-001)

- Added reusable `pnpm db:verify-live` read-only live connection certification,
  including project identity, bounded Management API SQL, REST table checks, anon
  RLS behavior, migration metadata, and transaction-pooler SQL verification.
- Added server-only QA helpers for read-only queries, table checks, bounded waits,
  exact UI/database comparisons, QA run IDs, QA record identification, and
  sanitized reports/errors, with four focused tests.
- Updated `db:status` to read migration metadata through the Management API when
  the linked session pooler times out. Confirmed 107 unique local versions versus
  33 remote versions: 79 local-only and 5 remote-only.
- Added ignored browser auth-state paths and a sanitized reuse guide under
  `docs/qa/`. Existing secret files remain ignored and no secret was committed.
- Regenerated live Supabase types with no diff. Authenticated CRM Today opened on
  localhost:3000 without console errors, and its zero Today/home-service values
  matched a safe live aggregate query for the same branch/date.
- Verification passes: live health check; type-check; 132 files / 962 tests; lint
  with one existing Attendance-only warning; production build with 110 routes.
  No live data, migrations, RLS, or migration history were modified.

## 2026-07-15 - Codex (CRADLEHUB-CORE-SYSTEMS-BETA-READINESS-001)

- Audited the core systems outside Attendance across auth/RBAC, CRM Today,
  bookings, schedules, dispatch, customers, staff/setup, payments,
  reconciliation, notifications, public booking, portals, realtime, integrity,
  security, failure handling, performance, mobile, and accessibility evidence.
- Linked REST schema verification passed for every configured critical table;
  direct migration-history verification timed out through the Supabase pooler.
- Type-check, 131 files / 958 tests, lint (one Attendance-only warning), and the
  production build with 110 routes passed.
- Authenticated mobile CRM smoke checks passed at 390x844 for Today, booking
  entry, Schedule, Dispatch, Reconciliation, and Staff Portal. Owner and driver
  routes were denied to the CRM identity; public booking rendered without
  horizontal overflow. The configured localhost:3000 Google login loaded without
  console errors.
- No source change was made because no safe core defect was proven. Final decision
  is NO-GO pending migration-history reconciliation and a controlled write-heavy
  multi-role E2E with dedicated QA identities.

## 2026-07-15 - Codex (ATTENDANCE-BETA-READINESS-001)

- Confirmed the requested clean live baseline: six Attendance operational tables
  at zero, six registered devices, and nine preserved QR points.
- Audited live Attendance tables, RLS, policies, grants, indexes, functions,
  generated types, and migration history. All audited tables have RLS; request
  idempotency and single-open-record transaction guards are live.
- Found and repaired a beta-blocking schema drift: live `staff.is_cross_branch`
  was missing, so every valid public scan failed before device recognition.
  Added/applied the focused additive migration `20260714180606`.
- Verified a fresh unknown phone now reaches the required one-scan staff login UI
  at 360x740 with no horizontal overflow; revoked-device and invalid-QR states
  remain blocked. No staff credentials were available for final continuation.
- Added a committed Training Mode result flag and visible `Training Mode · Not
  live attendance` staff badge, plus regression coverage.
- Regenerated live Supabase types and verified a controlled Training Mode scan
  transaction commits once and replays the same request idempotently. Removed
  only the exact audit-created rows; final operational counts returned to zero.
- Final verification: type-check passes; 131 files / 958 tests pass; lint exits
  successfully; production build passes with 110 generated pages.
- Decision: NO-GO until migration history is reconciled and authenticated real-
  device clock-in/out/registration, Recovery, realtime, and browser matrices pass.

> APPEND ONLY. Never delete entries. Every agent adds to the bottom.

## 2026-07-13 - Codex (CRADLE-ADJUST-SCHEDULE-MODAL-003)

**Task:** Build the production Adjust Schedule modal for CRM Schedule Daily Timeline without redesigning Daily Timeline or reviving group schedule runtime behavior.

**Files Added:**
- `src/components/features/schedule-adjustment/*` - reusable Adjust Schedule dialog, staff identity/status/profile/preview/impact panels, weekly matrix, bulk edit popover, date/block wrappers, exceptions empty state, typed draft model, and draft utilities.
- `tests/lib/schedule/adjust-schedule-utils.test.ts` - schedule adapter/duration/validation/role eligibility coverage.
- `tests/lib/schedule/daily-timeline-selection-card.test.tsx` - selected-staff action coverage.
- `tests/lib/schedule/adjust-schedule-dialog.test.tsx` - modal default mode, role-aware controls, and split-window preview coverage.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/daily-timeline-tab.tsx` - replaced the old Adjust Staff availability editor path with the shared `AdjustScheduleDialog`; Block Staff Time opens the new modal in Unavailable Time mode; conflict actions map into the same modal modes.
- `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/daily-timeline-operations-rail.tsx` - passes the shared Adjust Schedule handler into the selected-staff card.
- `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/daily-timeline-selection-card.tsx` - added Adjust Schedule alongside Edit Profile, Edit Capabilities, and View Full Schedule while preserving the compact card style.
- `src/lib/actions/crm-schedule-availability.ts` - added typed ordered-window weekly schedule save action that verifies staff/branch/operational state and reuses `replace_staff_weekly_schedule`.
- `src/lib/schedule/staff-schedule-write.ts` - added ordered-window row builder preserving unconfigured days, day-off markers, split windows, explicit overnight state, overlap validation, and role-aware Opening/Closing eligibility.
- `src/lib/queries/staff.ts` and `src/components/features/staff-schedule/staff-schedule-types.ts` - include schedule window order, explicit overnight state, timestamps, avatar, and system role fields needed by the modal.
- `supabase/migrations/20260712165012_backend_stabilization_schedule_repair.sql` - extended the pending schedule repair migration for ordered windows and SQL-side shift eligibility validation.
- `.context/*`, `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, and `docs/ROADMAP.md` - record implementation and verification.

**Behavior:**
- Quick Actions > Adjust Staff and selected-staff card > Adjust Schedule now open the same modal, target contract, draft adapter, weekly save action, and refresh path.
- Individual `staff_schedules` remain authoritative. No group controls, group labels, Copy From Group, Reset to Group, View Group, automatic fallback, or placeholder 21-row behavior was reintroduced.
- Weekly mode supports role-aware Opening/Regular/Closing controls for therapists/CRM, Regular-only controls for other staff, split windows, explicit Ends next day, Not Configured vs Day Off, live preview, weekly totals, validation, and acknowledged impact review before saving.
- Specific Date and Unavailable Time modes reuse the existing real `schedule_overrides` and `blocked_times` actions. Approved Exceptions shows an honest empty state because no durable exception model was found.

**Verification:**
- Focused tests: PASS, 4 files / 21 tests.
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS.
- `pnpm test --run`: PASS, 91 files / 717 tests.
- `pnpm build`: PASS, Next.js 16.2.4, 108 routes.
- `git diff --check`: PASS, CRLF warnings only.

**Follow-up:**
- Authenticated CRM browser QA is still needed for visual/operator certification against live branch data.
- Server-calculated affected-booking impact/acknowledgement remains future hardening; current saves do not modify bookings.
- Date range overrides, expanded blocked-time reason taxonomy, and durable approved-exception records need schema/action support before they can be fully implemented.

---

## 2026-07-13 - Codex (CRADLE-INDIVIDUAL-SCHEDULING-SIMPLIFICATION-005)

**Task:** Simplify runtime scheduling around CRM-entered individual staff schedules.

**Files Added:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260712190359_individual_schedule_runtime_only.sql` - runtime RPC replacement for individual-only `get_available_slots` and `get_daily_schedule`.
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/staff-schedule-types.ts` - shared type-only schedule item contract after deleting duplicate schedule list UI.

**Files Changed / Removed:**
- Removed manual paper schedule importer files/actions and paper roster generation paths.
- Removed group schedule runtime fallback from `resolve-staff-schedule`, runtime schedule queries, realtime subscriptions, booking/attendance/dispatch/readiness consumers, and Schedule UI.
- Removed legacy group schedule action/query/test helpers and duplicate Schedule Setup UI clusters.
- Reduced `/crm/schedule` tabs to Daily Timeline and Schedule Setup; `/crm/staff-availability` redirects to `/crm/schedule?tab=setup` and `/crm/availability` redirects to `/crm/schedule`.
- Individual weekly saves now use ordered-window identity, operational staff validation, exact returned-row verification, and no inactive placeholder sibling rows.
- Regenerated `src/types/supabase.ts`; widened branch booking rules mapping for pending live distance-fee columns.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm db:types`: PASS.
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS.
- `pnpm test --run`: PASS, 88 files / 702 tests.
- `pnpm build`: PASS, Next.js 16.2.4, 108 routes.
- `git diff --check`: PASS, CRLF warnings only.

**Database Notes:**
- `pnpm db:doctor` and `pnpm db:status` still time out while reading linked Supabase migration history through the pooler.
- `pnpm db:verify` runs linked SQL/table probes but exits nonzero because `psql` is not installed for fallback.
- Production migration apply is not claimed; apply local migrations from a working migration-history connection.

---

## 2026-07-12 - Codex (ATTENDANCE-TODAY-ALIGNMENT-RESET-001)

**Task:** Repair the existing CradleHub QR Attendance flow after launch-day reversed clock-in/clock-out loops, without adding a second attendance engine or duplicate recovery module.

**Files Added:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260712000100_attendance_state_reset.sql` - extends `attendance_corrections` action constraints with `reset_attendance_state`.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/attendance/attendance-intent-engine.ts` - added pure open-checkin classification for matching current shift, stale prior rows, same-day conflicts, and legacy generic shift fallback by scheduled-window overlap.
- `src/lib/attendance/scan-engine.ts` - resolves branch time/schedule before interpreting open attendance rows; uses only the matching current shift row for clock-out; sends stale/conflicting rows to Recovery while continuing current scan intent.
- `src/lib/attendance/attendance-correction-service.ts` - replaced broad staff-day reset semantics with selected-record Attendance State Reset requiring reason and void confirmation.
- `src/lib/attendance/queries.ts` - selects newer correction audit fields so reset-state entries render with action/date/actor context.
- `src/components/features/attendance/recovery/*` - renamed the repair surface to Attendance State Repair, added required reason/confirmation UI, and routed recovery issues into the reset panel.
- `tests/lib/attendance/attendance-intent-engine.test.ts` - added coverage for stale prior-day rows, exact current-shift rows, legacy generic overlap, and same-day conflict classification.

**Behavior:**
- Opening scans now clock in for the current scheduled shift even when an old stale open row exists.
- Closing scans clock out only when an open row matches the current staff/branch/shift date/shift type or legacy overlapping schedule window.
- Closing-time scans with no matching current clock-in remain `likely_closing_scan_without_clock_in` Recovery items and do not create a new check-in.
- Stale/conflicting open rows create/update Recovery exceptions instead of being silently reused.
- Active service clock-out blocking remains in the matching-current-shift clock-out path.
- Reset Next Scan State voids only the selected interpreted attendance record, preserves raw QR scans/history, resolves related open exceptions, and records an audit row.

**Verification:**
- `npx vitest run tests/lib/attendance/attendance-intent-engine.test.ts`: PASS, 16 tests.
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS.
- `pnpm test`: PASS, 85 files / 688 tests.
- `pnpm build`: PASS, Next.js 16.2.4, 108 routes.
- `pnpm db:doctor`: blocked on remote migration-history connection timeout to Supabase port 5432, same as previous handoffs, even after unrestricted retry.
- `pnpm db:status`: blocked on the same migration-history timeout; output included `Remote schema changed: no`.

**Follow-up:**
- Apply/push `supabase/migrations/20260712000100_attendance_state_reset.sql` from a working Supabase DB path before production use of the new reset action.
- Run authenticated CRM/Owner Attendance browser QA for Recovery issue triage, Attendance State Repair, live QR scan clock-in/out, stale-row Recovery surfacing, active-service block, and Owner Attendance parity.
- `git diff --check` remains blocked by pre-existing unrelated blank-line-at-EOF issues and line-ending warnings outside this task's attendance edits.

---

## 2026-07-10 - Codex (CRM-BOOKING-FOLLOWUP-STABILIZATION-001)

**Task:** Stabilize CRM Today and Booking Follow-up before adding operational reschedule/change-staff completion.

**Files Added:**
- `src/components/features/bookings/reschedule-booking-modal.tsx` - CRM reschedule modal backed by a branch-checked server action.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/crm/today/work-queue-panel.tsx`, `work-queue-dashboard.tsx`, `crm-today-shell.tsx`, and `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/today/page.tsx` - removed the fragile `refreshEtaAction` prop chain; the ETA button imports the stable server action directly.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/bookings/actions.ts` - status updates now use the admin client after session/branch checks and annotate the latest trigger-created `booking_events` row.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/bookings/actions.ts` - added follow-up audit rows, cancel support, reassignment availability validation/audit, and `rescheduleBookingAction`.
- `src/components/features/bookings/booking-followup-modal.tsx` and `bookings-table.tsx` - follow-up cancel/reschedule flows now use CRM actions; reschedule opens a real scheduling modal.
- `src/lib/assignments/recommendation-engine.ts`, `src/lib/queries/assignment-recommendations.ts`, and `tests/lib/assignments/recommendation-engine.test.ts` - hardened unavailable staff scoring for conflicts/home-service eligibility and exclude the edited booking from recommendation conflicts.
- Attendance Recovery inherited type/lint blockers were repaired in `src/components/features/attendance/recovery/attendance-recovery-tab.tsx` and `src/components/features/attendance/attendance-workspace.tsx`.

**Behavior:**
- CRM Today no longer passes a server action prop through client/server component boundaries for ETA refresh.
- Booking Follow-up no longer exposes raw `booking_events`/RLS errors for cancel/follow-up paths.
- Follow-up results write same-status audit rows through the service-role path, while true status changes annotate trigger-created events.
- Change Staff uses the assignment assistant, blocks unavailable therapists, preserves the customer-selected appointment time, and records a booking audit row.
- Reschedule explicitly moves date/time through a CRM modal, validates current therapist/room availability, records metadata/history, writes a same-status booking audit row, and notifies the assigned therapist.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS.
- `pnpm test --run tests/lib/assignments/recommendation-engine.test.ts`: PASS, 1 file / 6 tests.
- `pnpm build`: PASS, Next.js 16.2.4, 108 routes.

**Follow-up:**
- Authenticated CRM browser QA is still recommended for `/crm/today` ETA refresh, `/crm/bookings` follow-up cancel/reschedule, Change Staff, and Reschedule modal flows against live branch data.

---

## 2026-06-07 - Codex (PUBLIC-PAGES-DARK-THEME-001 - Public Pages Dark Theme)

**Task:** Restyle `/services`, `/contact`, `/about`, and `/branches` plus the shared public catalog/header surfaces so the requested public page set no longer uses white, cream, pale gray, or default-light page/card sections.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(public)/services/page.tsx` - replaced the pale hero bridge and info card with dark/gold surfaces.
- `src/app/(public)/contact/page.tsx` - moved desktop action/contact sections from cream/white cards to dark glass cards.
- `src/app/(public)/about/page.tsx` - moved desktop story, values, and secondary sections to dark surfaces and dark glass value cards.
- `src/app/(public)/branches/page.tsx` - moved desktop branch list and empty state to dark surfaces and dark glass branch cards.
- `src/components/public/service-catalog-client.tsx` - converted empty state, catalog background, sidebar, service rows, badges, CTAs, and bottom help panel to dark/gold styling.
- `src/components/public/site-header.tsx` - kept the shared header dark in desktop scrolled mode and removed white hover fills.
- `src/components/public/mobile/public-mobile-services.tsx` - replaced cream mobile sections, service rows, categories, empty state, and CTAs with the dark Cradle treatment.
- `src/components/public/mobile/public-mobile-contact.tsx` - replaced cream mobile action/branch/hour cards with dark glass cards and added viewport-safe branch text wrapping.
- `src/components/public/mobile/public-mobile-about.tsx` - replaced the cream story panel with dark glass styling.
- `src/components/public/mobile/public-mobile-branches.tsx` - replaced cream branch cards with dark stacked image cards and viewport-safe action/address layout.
- `.context/CURRENT_TASK.cmd.md`, `.context/HANDOFF.cmd.md`, `.context/CHANGELOG.cmd.md`, `.context/ERRORS.cmd.md` - updated task records.
- `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md` - logged the public dark theme pass.

**Behavior:**
- Public mobile `/services`, `/contact`, `/about`, and `/branches` now use deep green backgrounds, muted gold borders/actions, cream text, and translucent dark cards.
- Desktop public sections for the requested pages now match the dark Cradle theme instead of transitioning into pale cream page bands.
- The shared service catalog now remains dark from empty state through category navigation, service rows, badges, prices, and CTA panel.
- The shared public header no longer switches to a cream desktop header when scrolled.
- Mobile branch and contact rows now wrap long branch names/addresses safely without clipping action labels.
- Booking logic, service/branch queries, Supabase/database logic, server actions, protected portals, auth/RBAC, APIs, and backend behavior were not changed.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS
- `pnpm lint`: PASS (0 errors, 2 existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`)
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 98 routes
- Scoped source scan: PASS, no `bg-white`, `bg-[#FCFAF5]`, `bg-[#F7F3EB]`, `bg-[#FBF6EC]`, cream inline background, or `hover:bg-white` matches in the requested route/component set.
- Temporary production route checks on `http://localhost:3011`: `/services`, `/contact`, `/about`, and `/branches` all returned HTTP 200.
- Headless Chrome production screenshots captured at `.tmp/public-dark-screens-prod/` for mobile 390x844 and desktop 1440x1100.
- Visual spot-check confirmed dark services desktop catalog and mobile branches layout with no clipped action labels.

**Follow-up:**
- Unrelated public home/SEO landing components still contain intentional light marketing sections and were left out of scope.
- Tool discovery did not expose the in-app browser controller in this turn; local headless Chrome was used for visual QA instead.

---

### 2026-04-29 — Codex (Phase 0 initialization)

### 2026-06-15 — Codex (OWNER-DASHBOARD-REDESIGN-001)

**Task:** Rebuilt `/owner` Overview to match the approved Owner Dashboard reference while using real CradleHub data and the existing dashboard shell.

**Files Added:**
- `src/lib/owner/dashboard.ts` — pure dashboard business rules and section load helpers.
- `src/lib/queries/owner-dashboard.ts` — Owner-only server data loader with section-level error states.
- `src/components/features/owner/dashboard/*` — Owner overview panels, client-side local filters, and formatting helpers.
- `tests/lib/owner/dashboard.test.ts` — focused business-rule coverage for dashboard metrics and partial failures.

**Behavior:**
- `/owner` now renders hero, attention banner, five KPI cards, Today at a Glance, Branch Performance, Revenue Trend, Staff Snapshot, Quick Actions, Payroll Snapshot, and Pending Actions.
- The page preserves the existing Owner sidebar/header/workspace guard; no global shell, theme primitive, or shadcn primitive was redesigned.
- Metrics use real tables: `bookings`, `branches`, `staff`, `staff_schedules`, `staff_shift_checkins`, `workspace_notifications`, `workflow_tasks`, and fixed-monthly payroll query data.
- Today's revenue is paid `bookings.amount_paid` for active bookings scheduled today; completed today requires `session_completed_at` or `completed_at` on today's branch-local date.
- Staff on shift is schedule-based while `MVP_CHECKIN_PAUSED` remains true; check-in rows are still supported by the pure helper for the future unpaused mode.
- Query failures are surfaced as section/card-level unavailable states instead of silently turning into zeroes.
- Pending Approvals from the mockup is implemented as Pending Actions because the current app has notifications/workflow tasks but no formal approvals module.

**Related Cleanup:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/branches/[branchId]/branch-edit-form.tsx` now uses a keyed inner form to reset branch edit state without a set-state-in-effect lint violation.
- `src/components/features/payroll/employee-payroll-table.tsx` no longer syncs derived branch/page values back into state with set-state-in-effect; displayed values continue to come from the derived view.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm test tests/lib/owner/dashboard.test.ts`: PASS, 13 tests.
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS, with existing warnings only in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs` and payroll test mocks.
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 97 routes; `/owner` generated as dynamic.
- `pnpm test`: PARTIAL, 467/469 passing; the two failures remain the known unrelated booking progress state-machine expectations in `tests/lib/bookings/progress.test.ts`.
- Browser smoke on existing `http://localhost:3000/owner`: redirects unauthenticated users to `/login` and captured no local app console errors. Authenticated Owner visual QA still needs a logged-in Owner session.

**Build Status:** ✅ Passing

### 2026-06-15 — Codex (OWNER-RECONNECT-001)

**Task:** Restored the existing Owner workspace entry points without changing CRM, Staff Portal, Driver Portal, public booking, scheduling, dispatch, or database behavior.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/layout.tsx` — replaced the MVP redirect-to-CRM layout with an Owner workspace guard that redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`, non-owner workspace users to their workspace switch destination, and mounts `OWNER_PREFETCH`.
- `src/lib/auth/workspace-access.ts` and `src/proxy.ts` — extracted protected workspace path authorization into `canAccessWorkspacePath()` so proxy behavior is test-covered without broadening access.
- `src/components/features/dashboard/nav-config.ts` — restored Owner role-to-nav resolution, removed Owner `mvpHidden`, kept Manager soft-paused to CRM, and removed the production `/dev` Owner nav link.
- `src/components/features/workspace/workspace-prefetch-config.ts` — removed stale `/owner/settings` and `/dev` Owner prefetch entries.
- `src/lib/permissions.ts` — restored owner default dashboard path to `/owner`; Manager and management variants remain `/crm`.
- `tests/lib/auth/workspace-access.test.ts` — added focused coverage for Owner workspace grants, route authorization, nav visibility, and Owner prefetch route validity.
- `vitest.config.ts` — added the test-runner alias for the existing TypeScript `@/* -> src/*` path mapping.

**Behavior:**
- Owners now receive Owner + CRM + Staff Portal workspace access, with `/owner` as the primary workspace and `/select-workspace` when multiple workspaces are available.
- `/owner/*` is reachable only for users whose workspace resolver includes `owner`.
- CRM, staff, driver, utility, and public booking flows were not changed.
- Manager remains soft-paused through its existing layout and role/default routing.
- No Supabase schema, RLS, migration, or service-role changes were made.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS
- `pnpm lint`: PASS, with 2 existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`
- `pnpm test tests/lib/auth/workspace-access.test.ts`: PASS, 8 tests
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 98 routes, including restored `/owner/*` route generation
- `rg -n "service_role|SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" src`: only existing `src/lib/supabase/admin.ts`
- `rg -n "DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY|auth\.uid\(\) IS NOT NULL" supabase`: no matches
- `rg -n "/owner/settings" src`: no matches
- `pnpm test`: PARTIAL, 428/430 passing; two unrelated booking progress expectations fail in `tests/lib/bookings/progress.test.ts`

**Build Status:** ✅ Passing

... [86,000 characters omitted] ...

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 71 app routes.

### 2026-05-11 — Kimi (MGR-MOB-001 — Mobile Manager Workspace)

**Task:** Create a mobile-first simplified Manager Workspace that activates only on mobile breakpoints without breaking the existing desktop experience.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/manager/mobile/types.ts` — shared mobile types
- `src/components/features/manager/mobile/manager-mobile-workspace.tsx` — main mobile orchestrator with tab state
- `src/components/features/manager/mobile/manager-bottom-nav.tsx` — fixed bottom navigation (Today, Schedule, Bookings, Staff, More)
- `src/components/features/manager/mobile/manager-today-screen.tsx` — greeting, KPIs, quick actions, today's flow, attention needed
- `src/components/features/manager/mobile/manager-schedule-screen.tsx` — staff schedule list with filter pills
- `src/components/features/manager/mobile/manager-bookings-screen.tsx` — bookings/issues cards with search and filters
- `src/components/features/manager/mobile/manager-staff-screen.tsx` — active/pending/off-duty staff cards
- `src/components/features/manager/mobile/manager-approvals-screen.tsx` — approval queue summary + operations tiles
- `src/components/features/manager/mobile/manager-more-screen.tsx` — branch summary, alerts, settings menu

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/page.tsx` — responsive wrapper (hidden md:block desktop / block md:hidden mobile); fetches schedule + staff data for mobile while preserving desktop props exactly

**Design Decisions:**
- Desktop workspace is completely untouched; same component tree, same props, same data flow.
- Mobile workspace reuses existing data queries and utility functions (computeKpiData, computeAlerts, getUrgencyScore, readRelation, etc.).
- Bottom nav uses Lucide icons with large tap targets and clear active states.
- All screens use card-based layouts, large text, and spa design tokens (--cs-*).
- Empty states are included on every list screen.
- Placeholder actions (Review/Resolve) are rendered with disabled state where full server action wiring does not yet exist.

**Build Status:** ✅ Passing | **Type-check:** ✅ Passing | **Lint:** ✅ Passing (0 errors, 0 warnings)

### 2026-05-12 — Kimi (ONBOARD-001 — Eliminate Legacy Invite Flow, Refine Public Onboarding)

**Task:** Remove the insecure legacy invite flow (`/onboard/[staffId]`) that created incomplete staff records. Refine the public `/staff-onboarding` page to be the single entry point for staff applications, with proper `staff_type` mapping from the applicant's selected role.

**Files Removed:**
- `src/app/onboard/[staffId]/page.tsx` — legacy invite claim page
- `src/app/onboard/[staffId]/onboard-form.tsx` — legacy invite claim form
- `src/lib/queries/staff.ts` — removed unused `getStaffForOnboard` query

**Files Created:**
- `src/app/onboard/page.tsx` — simple redirect to `/staff-onboarding`

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/staff/actions.ts`
  - Removed `generateInviteAction` — no longer creates incomplete "Pending Invitation" staff rows.
  - Removed `onboardStaffAction` — eliminated the unauthenticated auth-user creation security hole.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/staff/invite/page.tsx`
  - Rewritten as a read-only info page. Passes `onboardingUrl` and `accessCode` to the form.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/staff/invite/invite-form.tsx`
  - Rewritten to display the public onboarding URL and access code with copy buttons.
  - Removed `generateInviteAction` dependency.
  - Added link to Onboarding Requests page.
- `src/app/staff-onboarding/actions.ts`
  - Added `mapPreferredRoleToStaffType()` helper: `therapist`→`therapist`, `csr`→`csr`, `driver`→`driver`, `utility`→`utility`, `other`→`therapist`.
  - `submitStaffOnboardingAction`: now sets `staff_type` on the created inactive staff row.
  - `submitStaffOnboardingAction`: fixed `requested_branch_id` to use the resolved `branchId` (fallback to first branch) instead of potentially-null `preferredBranchId`.
  - `approveOnboardingAction`: now derives and sets `staff_type` from the request's `preferred_role` when activating the staff record.
- `docs/MVP_SYSTEM_SCORE_REPORT.md`
  - Marked C5 (`onboardStaffAction` security) and H4 (`generateInviteAction` validation) as ✅ FIXED.
  - Updated RBAC score from 6→7 and risks table.

**Behavior:**
- All staff onboarding now goes through `/staff-onboarding` (protected by `STAFF_ONBOARDING_ACCESS_CODE`).
- Applicants select their intended role during onboarding; the inactive staff record captures the matching `staff_type`.
- Owner/manager reviews applications in `/owner/staff/onboarding` or `/manager/staff/onboarding`.
- On approval, the staff record is activated with the reviewer-assigned `system_role`, `tier`, `branch_id`, and the applicant's `staff_type`.
- No more incomplete "Pending Invitation" staff rows polluting the database.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 76 app routes.

### 2026-05-12 — Kimi (ONBOARD-002 — CRM Staff Applications Review)

**Task:** Enable authorized CSR (front-desk) users to review and approve normal operational staff applications directly from the CRM workspace. This avoids the need for full Manager workspace access during MVP.

**Files Created:**
- `docs/MVP_TEMPORARY_PERMISSIONS.md` — documented temporary MVP permission rules
- `src/components/features/staff-onboarding/onboarding-review-list.tsx` — reusable review component extracted from owner dashboard
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/staff-applications/page.tsx` — new CRM staff application review page

**Files Removed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/staff/onboarding/review-list.tsx` — replaced by the reusable component

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/staff/approval-permissions.ts`
  - Updated CSR/CRM assignable roles to include `csr_staff`, `driver`, `utility`, and `staff`.
  - Enforced sensitive role restriction (CSR cannot approve managers/admins).
- `src/components/features/dashboard/nav-config.ts`
  - Added "Staff Applications" to CRM, CSR Head, and CSR Staff navigation.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/staff/onboarding/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/staff/onboarding/page.tsx`
  - Refactored to use the new reusable `OnboardingReviewList` component.

**Behavior:**
- CSR users see "Staff Applications" in their sidebar.
- CSRs can review applicants for their assigned branch.
- CSRs can approve only operational roles; management roles show "Owner/Manager required" and have the Approve button disabled.
- Fixed role mapping: CSR applicants now default to `system_role: csr_staff` when reviewed, ensuring they land in the correct workspace.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 77 app routes.

### 2026-05-13 — Kimi (BRANCH-SOT-001 — Public Branch Address Source of Truth)

**Task:** Unify public branch/contact data into a single database source of truth. Eliminate dual-sourcing between `branches` table and hardcoded `public-site-data.ts`.

**Files Created:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260516000001_branch_public_fields.sql` — adds `opening_hours`, `secondary_phone`, `sort_order` to `branches`

**Files Changed:**
- `src/types/supabase.ts` — added `opening_hours`, `secondary_phone`, `sort_order` to `branches` Row/Insert/Update types
- `src/lib/queries/branches.ts` — added `getPublicBranches()` helper (active branches ordered by `sort_order`, then `name`)
- `src/lib/public/public-site-data.ts` — marked `publicPhones` and `publicBranches` as `@deprecated` with explanation
- `src/app/(public)/layout.tsx` — now async; fetches `getPublicBranches()` and passes `primaryPhone` to `SiteHeader`, `branches` to `SiteFooter`
- `src/app/page.tsx` — now async; fetches `getPublicBranches()`, passes to `SiteHeader`, `SiteFooter`, `PublicMobileHome`, `HomePageSections`; FAQ answers now dynamically list branch names from DB
- `src/app/(public)/contact/page.tsx` — uses branch data for primary/secondary phones, opening hours, branch name/address cards, and CTA call button
- `src/app/(public)/branches/page.tsx` — switched to `getPublicBranches()`; per-branch `opening_hours` replaces hardcoded "Daily · 9:00 AM – 9:00 PM"
- `src/components/public/site-header.tsx` — accepts `primaryPhone` prop instead of importing hardcoded `publicPhones`
- `src/components/public/site-footer.tsx` — accepts `branches` prop; derives hours text from first branch `opening_hours`
- `src/components/public/home-page-sections.tsx` — accepts `branches` prop; contact section phones, branch cards, and CTA buttons now use branch data
- `src/components/public/mobile/public-mobile-home.tsx` — accepts `branches` prop; FAQ branch answer is now dynamic
- `src/components/public/mobile/public-mobile-contact.tsx` — `primaryPhoneHref()` now uses first branch phone; opening hours uses branch `opening_hours`
- `src/components/public/mobile/public-mobile-branches.tsx` — uses `branch.opening_hours` instead of hardcoded fallback text

**Design Decisions:**
- Marketing narrative (hero copy, proof points, trust points) remains in `public-site-data.ts` and `public_site_sections` table. Only operational contact/address/hours data was migrated.
- All components keep safe fallbacks when branch data is missing: "Contact info updating", "Branch details are being updated", etc.
- `getPublicBranches()` orders by `sort_order` then `name`, giving owners control over display order without code changes.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 4 pre-existing warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 77 app routes.

### 2026-05-13 — Kimi (PAYMENT-001 — Manual Payment Recording Capability)

**Task:** Wire PaymentActionMenu into all workspace contexts, create booking_payment_logs audit table, and ensure all payment changes are logged with old→new values.

**Files Created:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260517000001_booking_payment_logs.sql` — append-only audit table for payment changes
- `supabase/migrations/20260517000002_update_daily_schedule_payment_fields.sql` — adds payment fields to `get_daily_schedule` RPC

**Files Changed:**
- `src/types/supabase.ts` — added `booking_payment_logs` table type
- `src/lib/validations/booking.ts` — extended `updateBookingPaymentSchema` with optional `reason` field
- `src/components/features/dashboard/payment-action-menu.tsx` — added `reason` state, `confirmUnpaid` view, significant-change guard (requires reason for voids/refunds/corrections)
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/bookings/actions.ts` — `ownerUpdateBookingPaymentAction` now reads old values, inserts audit log, then updates
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/bookings/actions.ts` — `updateBookingPaymentAction` now reads old values, inserts audit log, then updates
- `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-details-panel.tsx` — fixed hardcoded payment values, now passes actual booking payment state
- `src/lib/queries/schedule.ts` — `DailyScheduleBooking` type extended with payment fields
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/bookings/page.tsx` — wired `updateBookingPaymentAction`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/schedule/page.tsx` — wired `updateBookingPaymentAction`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/bookings/page.tsx` — wired `updateBookingPaymentAction`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/schedule/page.tsx` — wired `updateBookingPaymentAction`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/today/page.tsx` — computes `price_paid` from metadata, passes `paymentAction` to queue panel
- `src/components/features/crm/today/crm-booking-queue-panel.tsx` — added inline `PaymentActionMenu` on each card with event propagation stop

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 4 pre-existing warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 77 app routes.

### 2026-05-13 — Kimi (CONTROL-001 — Booking Control Console MVP)

**Task:** Create a professional operational control page for manager and CRM users showing today's bookings with KPIs, progress status, payment actions, and home-service warnings.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/control-console/types.ts` — `ControlBooking` and `ControlTab` types
- `src/components/features/control-console/control-kpi-strip.tsx` — 7 KPI cards (Total, Active, In Progress, Completed, Unpaid, Home Service, Issues)
- `src/components/features/control-console/control-booking-card.tsx` — Enhanced booking card with progress mini-stepper, payment badge, status badge, home-service warnings, and inline action buttons
- `src/components/features/control-console/control-queue.tsx` — Filterable queue with tabs: All, Active, Home, In Spa, Unpaid, Issues
- `src/components/features/control-console/control-console-page.tsx` — Main layout with KPIs, queue, and operational summary side rail
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/control/page.tsx` — Manager control console route (branch-scoped)
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/control/page.tsx` — CRM control console route (branch-scoped)

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/queries/bookings.ts` — added `booking_progress_status` and timestamp fields to `TODAY_SCHEDULE_SELECT` variants; added `MaybeProgressFields` to `TodayScheduleRow`
- `src/components/features/dashboard/nav-config.ts` — added "Control" to Manager, CRM, CSR Head, and CSR Staff navigation

**Design Decisions:**
- Reuses `getTodaysSchedule` and existing server actions (`updateBookingPaymentAction`, `updateBookingStatusAction`).
- No new external APIs, no live maps, no GPS tracking.
- Cards show progress as a compact dot stepper rather than full timeline.
- Home service warnings (dispatch_warning, needs_location_review) are shown as red banners at the top of affected cards.
- Issues tab surfaces: dispatch warnings, location review needs, missing room assignments, and unassigned staff.
- Staff availability diagnostic is a placeholder linking to Schedule/Staff settings pages.
- Owner control console is documented as a Phase 3.1 follow-up (requires cross-branch today's schedule query).

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 4 pre-existing warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 79 app routes.

**Follow-up:**
- Phase 3.1: Owner cross-branch control console.
- Phase 4: Booking Delivery Type Cleanup (`in_spa` as first-class type).

### 2026-05-13 — Kimi (MGR-STAFF-001 — Manager Staff Parity)

**Task:** Give Manager workspace the same staff-management capabilities as Owner, safely branch-scoped, without redesigning staff management.

**Files Created:**
- `docs/MANAGER_STAFF_PARITY_AUDIT.md` — full audit of Owner vs Manager staff capabilities, gaps, safe parity plan, and implementation summary
- `src/components/features/staff/staff-edit-form.tsx` — shared reusable staff edit form extracted from Owner route
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/staff/[staffId]/page.tsx` — Manager staff detail/edit page (branch-scoped)

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/staff/[staffId]/page.tsx` — refactored to use shared `StaffEditForm`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/staff/[staffId]/staff-edit-form.tsx` — DELETED (replaced by shared component)
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/staff/actions.ts` — hardened `updateStaffAction` with sensitive-role guards, manager-safe role enforcement, branch-change validation, and revalidation of both owner and manager paths
- `src/components/features/staff/staff-preview-panel.tsx` — Manager now sees "Change Role" and "Deactivate Staff" quick actions; "Assign Branch" remains Owner-only
- `src/components/features/manager/mobile/manager-staff-screen.tsx` — Staff cards are now clickable `Link` elements to detail pages
- `src/components/features/control-console/control-console-page.tsx` — fixed pre-existing `<a>` → `<Link>` lint error

**Behavior:**
- Manager can now edit staff profiles, update roles (manager-safe only), change tier/level, assign service capabilities, activate/deactivate, and toggle department head — all for staff in their branch.
- Branch field is locked to manager's branch.
- Protected accounts (owner, manager, assistant_manager, store_manager, super_admin, platform_admin) show "This action requires owner approval." and cannot be modified by manager.
- Owner staff management is untouched and continues to work with full controls.
- Mobile manager staff tab now links to detail edit pages.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 4 pre-existing warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 80 app routes.

**Follow-up:**
- Manager direct-invite (`/manager/staff/new`) if business wants managers to create staff directly.
- Staff delete/soft-delete if needed (currently only deactivate).

### 2026-05-13 - Codex (STAFF-ORG-001 - Staff Edit Organization & Access Model)

**Task:** Fix Staff Edit so it mirrors the full organizational model from owner-level access through operational staff, while keeping workspace access, job function, and supervisor status distinct.

**Files Created:**
- `src/constants/staff-roles.ts` - shared typed source for supported `system_role`, `staff_type`, service staff types, labels, options, sensitive role policy, and assignable role policy.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/constants/staff.ts` - compatibility re-export from the shared catalog.
- `src/lib/validations/staff.ts` - staff create/update schemas now accept every DB-supported system role and existing staff type.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/staff/actions.ts` - manager-safe role assignment and protected-role checks now use shared policy; non-service staff clear service mappings server-side.
- `src/components/features/staff/staff-edit-form.tsx` - added Organization & Access section, full role/function options, leadership toggle help text, active status help text, and service fields only for service staff functions.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/staff/new/staff-invite-form.tsx` - direct invite now uses the same role/function source and conditional service capability logic.
- `src/components/features/staff/staff-branch-section.tsx`, `staff-table-row.tsx`, `staff-preview-panel.tsx`, `staff-management-utils.ts`, `staff-filter-bar.tsx`, `staff-management-workspace.tsx` - display now separates Workspace Access from Staff Function and shows Head / Supervisor as distinct metadata.
- `src/lib/staff/approval-permissions.ts` - onboarding approval role lists now reuse shared assignable role arrays.
- `src/app/(auth)/login/actions.ts` - login redirect now uses shared role routing for driver, utility, service, and manager variant roles.
- `src/types/index.ts` - re-exports shared system roles and broadens staff tier typing to current schema values.
- `eslint.config.mjs` - ignores generated `.claude/**` worktree output so lint does not scan build artifacts.

**Behavior:**
- Driver, utility, CSR/front-desk, managerial, salon head, therapist, nail tech, and aesthetician functions are available in edit/direct invite.
- Owner can assign all DB-supported access roles; manager can assign only operational roles.
- Managers cannot edit protected owner/manager-level records or assign forbidden high-level access.
- Service assignment appears only for therapist, nail tech, aesthetician, and salon head.
- Saving driver/utility/CSR/managerial functions clears `staff_services` mappings even if stale client data is submitted.
- Defensive admin-like role names remain protected but are not exposed because current DB constraints do not support them.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 2 pre-existing warnings in staff onboarding form)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 79 app routes.

**Hotfix:**
- Added `public/sw.js` as a self-unregistering service worker cleanup script and no-store `/sw.js` headers in `next.config.ts`.
- Reason: browser logs showed stale `/sw.js` activity and stale client chunks still requiring the old `@base-ui/react/button` module after the Button component moved to Radix Slot.
- Verification after hotfix: `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm lint`, and `pnpm build` still pass.

### 2026-05-14 - Codex (PHASE-10.1 - Compact Precise Home-Service Location Input)

**Task:** Refine the existing public booking wizard home-service location step into a compact Google-Maps-style precise location input.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/public/places-autocomplete.tsx` - extended the shared Places wrapper to return formatted address, place ID, lat/lng, address components, map URL, and load/error status without exposing the server Maps key.
- `src/components/public/booking-wizard.tsx` - public home-service location step now shows one Google Places search field, a compact selected-location confirmation card with Change, and one merged Delivery notes textarea.
- `src/lib/validations/booking.ts` - public multi-service booking validation now requires a selected Google place for home-service bookings while leaving in-spa unaffected.
- `src/lib/actions/online-booking.ts` - server action now enforces precise home-service place data and saves `formatted_address`, `place_id`, `lat`, `lng`, `address_components`, `map_url`, `source: "google_places"`, and `delivery_notes` while preserving legacy address/notes/zone keys.

**Behavior:**
- Public home-service customers must select a Google suggestion before continuing; typed text alone is rejected.
- Customer-facing zone, house/unit, landmark, and separate driver-note fields were removed/merged into a single Delivery notes field.
- Metadata keeps `zone: "unknown"` when customers are not asked to choose a zone, while precise lat/lng remain available for dispatch/ETA systems.
- In-spa booking flow is unchanged.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 2 pre-existing warnings in staff onboarding form)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 79 app routes.

- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/page.tsx` - manager dashboard surfaces open workflow tasks in a calm attention strip.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/staff/onboarding/page.tsx` - manager onboarding page passes open workflow tasks to the review list.
- `src/components/features/staff-onboarding/onboarding-review-list.tsx` - shows inline workflow task context for manager review.
- `src/components/features/notifications/*` - bell/list grouping and visual tone adjusted toward quieter workflow signals.
- `src/lib/notifications/create.ts` - legacy `createNotification()` now routes through deduped create/update helper.
- `src/lib/notifications/queries.ts` - active notification reads include resolved items for grouped inbox compatibility.
- `src/lib/notifications/types.ts`, `src/types/supabase.ts` - added workflow task and dedupe types.

**Behavior:**
- `staff_onboarding.submitted` creates one manager workflow task and one applicant status update.
- Routine onboarding no longer creates an urgent owner notification.
- CRM receives no staff onboarding notification.
- Missing service selections are metadata on the same manager review task, not a second manager notification.
- Approval/rejection resolves the manager workflow task and old legacy onboarding notifications for that request.
- Applicant receives one deduped approval/rejection status update.
- Existing direct notification callers remain compatible but now use dedupe keys.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: Passing.
- `pnpm lint`: Passing with 2 pre-existing warnings in `src/app/staff-onboarding/onboarding-form.tsx`.
- `pnpm build`: Passing, 80 app routes.

### 2026-05-14 — Claude (MOBILE-001 — Mobile-First Staff & Driver Portal)

**Task:** Add mobile-first UI to Staff Portal and Driver Portal without breaking existing desktop layouts.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/mobile/staff-mobile-bottom-nav.tsx` — Fixed mobile bottom nav (5 items) with active state
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/mobile/staff-mobile-home.tsx` — Full service staff mobile home: greeting, next action card, today timeline, overview stats, home service alert, quick links
- `src/components/features/driver/driver-mobile-home.tsx` — Driver-focused mobile home: greeting, current trip card, trip overview stats, upcoming trips list, quick actions

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/staff-portal/page.tsx` — Added `hidden md:block` / `block md:hidden` split; desktop unchanged, mobile renders StaffMobileHome
- `src/app/(dashboard)/driver/page.tsx` — Added `hidden md:block` / `block md:hidden` split; desktop unchanged, mobile renders DriverMobileHome

**Also in this session (schedule task):**
- `src/lib/staff-portal/schedule.ts` — StaffScheduleEvent type + buildDayEvents/buildWeekEvents helpers
- `src/app/(dashboard)/staff-portal/schedule/page.tsx` — My Schedule server route
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/staff-schedule-page.tsx` — Schedule client component (week grid + mobile agenda + bottom nav)
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/staff-schedule-page.module.css` — Schedule CSS module
- `src/components/features/dashboard/nav-config.ts` — Added "My Schedule" to STAFF_NAV_ITEMS

**Build Status:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 2 pre-existing warnings only)
- `pnpm build`: Not run (build was 80 routes prior; new routes add /staff-portal/schedule)

### 2026-05-14 - Codex (BOOKING-WIZARD-UX-10.2 - Public Booking Wizard Optimization)

**Task:** Fix active public booking wizard Places usage, compact the service-selection UX, and restrict specific staff selection to real qualified service providers.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/public/booking-service-picker.tsx` - extracted compact category-based booking service picker used by the wizard.
- `src/lib/staff/service-providers.ts` - shared guard for service-provider eligibility, hard-excluding driver/utility system roles and non-service job functions.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/public/booking-wizard.tsx` - delegates service selection to the compact picker; staff picker now keeps Any Available as default and hides unqualified providers.
- `src/components/public/places-autocomplete.tsx` - selected place result now carries `source: "google_places"` while continuing to use `google.maps.importLibrary("places")` and `PlaceAutocompleteElement`.
- `src/app/api/public/booking-context/route.ts` - public booking context now preserves service category metadata and returns staff service mappings for eligibility-aware filtering.
- `src/lib/engine/availability.ts` - availability results and auto-assignment now filter out driver, utility, CSR/front-desk, admin/owner/manager-only staff; selected staff must satisfy service capability constraints when mappings exist.
- `src/lib/actions/online-booking.ts` - multi-service specific staff submission now verifies eligibility against all selected services, not only the first.
- `src/features/maps/GoogleMapsProvider.tsx`, `src/features/maps/PlaceAutocompleteInput.tsx`, `src/features/maps/README.md` - browser map key usage now standardizes on `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_BROWSER_KEY`; the provider no longer requests legacy Places libraries.

**Behavior:**
- Active `/book` path has no legacy `google.maps.places.Autocomplete`, `AutocompleteService`, `PlacesService`, `libraries=places`, or `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` usage under `src`.
- Public home-service location remains a single Places API (New) search field, selected-location confirmation card, and optional delivery notes field.
- Service selection shows one category at a time instead of expanding the full catalog.
- Multi-service selection, total duration, and total price remain intact.
- Specific provider selection shows only active service-provider staff who are available for the selected slot and eligible for the selected service set; Any Available remains the default.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: Passing.
- `pnpm lint`: Passing with 2 pre-existing warnings in `src/app/staff-onboarding/onboarding-form.tsx`.
- `pnpm build`: Passing, 80 app routes.
- `/book` smoke test: Existing localhost dev server at port 3000 returned `200 OK`.

### 2026-05-15 — Claude Code (Phase 0 Stabilization — Batch 2)

**Task:** SECURITY-STAB-002 — Phase 0 security stabilization batch 2 (9 blockers)

**Files Changed:**
- `src/proxy.ts` — Removed unconditional userId+role log on every request; replaced with dev-only `console.debug`; also removed userId from the "no active staff record" path log.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/staff/actions.ts` — Replaced full raw-input `console.log` and full Zod-issues `console.error` in `updateStaffAction` with dev-only `console.debug` using safe boolean metadata only. No PII or payload logged in production.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/marketing/actions.ts` — Added `createClient`/`isDevAuthBypassEnabled` imports, `requireOwner()` helper, and owner auth guard to all four exported actions (saveMarketingSectionAction, createMarketingAssetAction, updateMarketingAssetAction, disableMarketingAssetAction). [Batch 1 — completed prior step]
- `src/lib/dev-bypass.ts` — Production guard already present (NODE_ENV !== "production"); no change required.
- `src/lib/logger.ts` — Created structured logger with `logError` and `logWarn`; stacks only in development; always emits JSON to stderr.
- `src/lib/actions/driver-actions.ts` — Replaced 2 silent `catch {}` blocks with `logError` calls (getBranchBookingDriverIds, getAvailableBranchDrivers).
- `src/lib/actions/eta-actions.ts` — Replaced 1 silent `catch {}` with `logError` (getNextBookingForStaff).
- `src/lib/actions/live-ops-actions.ts` — Replaced 1 silent `catch {}` with `logError` (getActiveTripsForOpsMap).
- `src/lib/actions/location-actions.ts` — Replaced 2 silent `catch {}` with `logError` (getLatestStaffLocationForBooking, getLatestLocationsForActiveHomeServiceTrips).
- `src/app/(dashboard)/dev/page.tsx` — Added `notFound()` guard in production; dev panel route now returns 404 in production.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/operations/page.tsx` — Added `redirect("/manager")` in production; Coming Soon tiles are hidden from real managers in production.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/bookings/actions.ts` — Added `.eq("branch_id", me.branch_id)` to the pre-confirmation booking fetch in `updateBookingStatusAction`; prevents cross-branch room-assignment probe.
- `next.config.ts` — Added baseline security headers (X-Frame-Options: DENY, X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy) for all routes.
- `.env.example` — Created with all 14 env vars found in `src/`; danger dev-bypass vars clearly marked.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: Passing.
- `pnpm lint`: Passing with only the 2 pre-existing warnings in `src/app/staff-onboarding/onboarding-form.tsx`.
- `pnpm build`: Passing, 80+ app routes compiled successfully.

### 2026-05-15 — Claude Code (Phase 1 Performance Quick Wins)

**Task:** PERF-PHASE1-001 — Phase 1 performance quick wins

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` — Removed redundant `force-dynamic` export; layout is already dynamic because `createClient()` calls `cookies()` from next/headers. Now uses `getLayoutStaffContext()` from the new cached helper instead of inline auth+staff DB calls.
- `src/lib/queries/staff-context.ts` — Created. React `cache()`-wrapped helper for the dashboard layout's auth + staff fetch. Deduplicates within a single request render tree. Sets up the pattern for Phase 2 broader deduplication.
- `src/lib/queries/branches.ts` — Added `getPublicBranchesCached` (React `cache()` wrapper around `getPublicBranches`). Deduplicates branch fetches within a request when multiple components in the public layout render tree call it.
- `src/app/(public)/layout.tsx` — Switched from `getPublicBranches` to `getPublicBranchesCached`.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/bookings/loading.tsx` — Created. Filter bar + booking row skeletons.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/schedule/loading.tsx` — Created. Date nav + timeline grid skeleton.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/settings/loading.tsx` — Created. Settings form section skeletons.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/loading.tsx` — Created. Stats strip + two-column content skeleton.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/bookings/loading.tsx` — Created. Search/filter bar + booking row skeletons.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/staff/loading.tsx` — Created. Search bar + staff card grid skeleton.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/staff-portal/loading.tsx` — Created. Greeting + stats + appointment card skeletons.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/staff-portal/schedule/loading.tsx` — Created. Week nav + day columns + appointment block skeletons.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/error.tsx` — Created. Manager workspace error boundary (client component with Try again reset).
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/error.tsx` — Created. CRM workspace error boundary.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/error.tsx` — Created. Owner workspace error boundary.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/staff-portal/error.tsx` — Created. Staff portal error boundary.

**What was intentionally NOT done in this phase:**
- No service worker / offline mode (Phase 3)
- No tag-based revalidation migration (Phase 2)
- No new DB indexes (Phase 2)
- No booking engine changes
- Dynamic import for Dispatch workspace: dispatch is currently mock data UI; not a priority.
- Cross-request cache for branches: React cache() deduplicates within a request; `unstable_cache` / ISR considered but deferred pending Next.js 16 behavioral verification.
- Target H (local refresh): no obvious safe wins found without deeper investigation.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: Passing.
- `pnpm lint`: Passing with only 2 pre-existing warnings in `src/app/staff-onboarding/onboarding-form.tsx`.
- `pnpm build`: Passing, 80+ app routes compiled successfully.

### 2026-05-15 — Claude Code (Phase 2 Database Request Optimization)

**Task:** PERF-PHASE2-001 — Phase 2 database request optimization

**Files Created:**
- `src/lib/queries/crm-context.ts` — Shared `getCrmContext()` helper for CRM page server components. Returns `{ role, branchId }` with owner getting `branchId: null` (cross-branch) and CRM/CSR roles getting their own `branch_id`.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/queries/customers.ts` — Added `branchCustomerIds()` private helper. Added optional `branchId?: string | null` parameter to `searchCustomers`, `getAllCustomers`, `getRepeatCustomers`, `getLapsedCustomers`, `getCrmStats`. When provided, each function first fetches distinct customer IDs from `bookings` for that branch, then filters customers via `.in("id", ids)`. Owners pass `null` and get unfiltered results. Also added a comment on `lookupCustomerByPhone` explaining it is intentionally not branch-scoped.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/actions.ts` — `requireCrmAccess()` now returns `{ supabase, branchId: string | null } | null` (was `supabase | null`). Now fetches `branch_id` from staff record. Owner role maps to `branchId: null`. Updated all callers to destructure `ctx` and pass `ctx.branchId` to query functions.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/customers/page.tsx` — Replaced local `getCsrContext()` + direct supabase calls with imported `getCrmContext()`. Passes `branchId` to `getAllCustomers(page, 25, branchId)`.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/repeats/page.tsx` — Added `getCrmContext()` import and call. Passes `branchId` to `getRepeatCustomers(2, page, 25, branchId)`. (Also adds a missing auth check — this page had no auth before.)
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/lapsed/page.tsx` — Added `getCrmContext()` import and call. Passes `branchId` to `getLapsedCustomers(30, 50, branchId)`. (Also adds a missing auth check — this page had no auth before.)
- `src/app/api/customers/search/route.ts` — Now fetches `branch_id` from the staff record in addition to `system_role`. Derives `branchId` (null for owners, `me.branch_id` for others) and passes to `searchCustomers(q, branchId)`.
- `src/lib/queries/staff.ts` — Added `.limit(500)` to both primary and fallback queries in `getAllStaff()`. Added `.limit(200)` to both queries in `getPendingStaff()`. Safety caps for the owner's cross-branch staff lists.
- `src/lib/queries/bookings.ts` — Added `.limit(50)` to `getBookingsByCustomer()` (customer profile booking history). Added `.limit(500)` safety cap to `getAllBookings()` (owner day view) and `getAllBookingsOwner()` (owner cross-branch booking list).

**What was intentionally NOT done in this phase:**
- `select("*")` wildcard replacement in branches and staff queries: The staff queries use a backward-compat fallback pattern that would be fragile to refactor. The branches table is small and `select("*")` is fine there. Deferred.
- Selective `revalidateTag` migration: Requires tagging all cached data and is a cross-cutting concern. The existing `revalidatePath` is correct. Deferred to Phase 3 if profiling shows stale-cache issues.
- DB index recommendations: No profiling data available. Adding indexes without evidence would be speculative. Deferred.
- `unstable_cache` / Next.js 16 `"use cache"` directive: Behavior in Next.js 16.2.4 was not verified. Deferred.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: Passing.
- `pnpm lint`: Passing with only 2 pre-existing warnings in `src/app/staff-onboarding/onboarding-form.tsx`.
- `pnpm build`: Passing, 80+ app routes compiled successfully.

### 2026-05-15 — Claude (PERF-PHASE2B-001 — Query Pagination + Index Planning)

**Task:** Phase 2B — Shared pagination utility, CRM customer paginated search, index audit.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/queries/pagination.ts` (NEW) — Shared pagination helpers: `PaginationParams`, `PaginatedResult<T>`, `normalizePagination()`, `toPaginatedResult()`. Normalizes page/pageSize with safe bounds; wraps Supabase count responses.
- `src/lib/queries/customers.ts` — Added `CustomerPageRow` exported type and `getCustomersPage()` function combining branch scoping + ILIKE search (with `%_` escaping) + server-side pagination via `.range(from, to)` with `count: "exact"`.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/customers/page.tsx` — Switched from `getAllCustomers` to `getCustomersPage`. Added `q` search param support. Added plain `<form method="GET">` search bar (no client state). Quick action cards hidden during active search. Pagination Prev/Next links now preserve `q` param via `encodeURIComponent`. EmptyState shows search-specific messaging.
- `docs/audits/QUERY_INDEX_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` (NEW) — Full audit of existing indexes from `20260429000002_indexes.sql`, identified `bookings(branch_id, customer_id)` as the key missing index for `branchCustomerIds()`, documented all bounded/unbounded queries.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/dev/page.tsx` — Fixed pre-existing TS2367 errors (NODE_ENV type narrowing after `notFound()` guard). Extracted `nodeEnv` variable before the guard.
- `src/lib/logger.ts` — Fixed pre-existing TS2345 errors by widening `LogContext` from `Record<string, string | number | boolean | null | undefined>` to `Record<string, unknown>` so `error: unknown` in catch blocks passes without casts.

**Scope deliberately NOT changed:**
- Booking list pages (manager/CRM/owner): already date+branch scoped, naturally bounded — no pagination needed.
- Staff list pages: `StaffManagementWorkspace` uses client-side filtering on safety-capped (500/200) server results. Pagination would require UI redesign. Deferred.
- `public-site.ts` list queries: CMS tables with owner-defined content — small by design, no limit needed.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 2 pre-existing warnings in `staff-onboarding/onboarding-form.tsx`)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 79+ app routes compiled successfully

### 2026-05-15 — Claude (PERF-PHASE3-001 — Selective Revalidation and Cache Tags)

**Task:** Phase 3 — Replace selected broad `revalidatePath()` usage with scoped cache tags using `unstable_cache` on stable read data.

**Files Created:**
- `src/lib/cache/cache-tags.ts` — Tag constants (`publicBranches`, `branchBookingRules(id)`, `branchServices(id)`) and `invalidateTag()` wrapper that handles Next.js 16's required second `profile` argument to `revalidateTag`.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/queries/branches.ts` — Upgraded `getPublicBranchesCached` from `React.cache()` (per-request only) to `React.cache(unstable_cache(...))` (cross-request + per-request dedup). Added `getBranchServicesPublicCached(branchId)` using `createAdminClient()` + `unstable_cache`; tags `branch-services:{branchId}`, TTL 300s.
- `src/lib/queries/branch-booking-rules.ts` — Added `getBranchBookingRulesOrDefaultCached(branchId)` using `unstable_cache`; tags `branch-booking-rules:{branchId}`, TTL 3600s. `updateBranchBookingRules` now calls `invalidateTag` on commit.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/branches/actions.ts` — All branch mutations (`createBranchAction`, `updateBranchAction`, `toggleBranchActiveAction`) now call `invalidateTag(cacheTags.publicBranches)`. All service mutations (`removeBranchServiceAction`, `addBranchServiceAction`, `updateBranchServiceEligibilityAction`, `updateBranchServicePriceAction`, `updateBranchServiceVisibilityAction`) now call `invalidateTag(cacheTags.branchServices(branchId))`.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/services/actions.ts` — `setBranchServiceAction` now calls `invalidateTag(cacheTags.branchServices(d.branchId))`.
- `src/app/api/public/booking-context/route.ts` — Hot path now uses `getBranchServicesPublicCached` (when `publicOnly=true`) and `getBranchBookingRulesOrDefaultCached`. Inhouse context (publicOnly=false) keeps uncached `getBranchServices`.
- `src/app/api/public/dispatch-slots/route.ts` — Now uses `getBranchBookingRulesOrDefaultCached`.

**Domains cached:**
1. Public branches (`public-branches` tag, 1h TTL)
2. Branch booking rules per branch (`branch-booking-rules:{id}` tag, 1h TTL)
3. Branch services — public-only (`branch-services:{id}` tag, 5min TTL)

**Intentionally NOT cached:**
- `getBranchesOverview` — includes live stats (today's bookings, active staff count)
- `getBranchWithFullDetail` — owner edit page; includes live staff list
- All booking/dispatch/schedule data
- Inhouse context service list (user-facing, may differ by role)
- Notification, payroll, reconciliation data

**Revalidation paths kept:**
- All existing `revalidatePath()` calls preserved alongside the new `invalidateTag()` calls. The path invalidation clears Next.js route cache; the tag invalidation clears the `unstable_cache` function result. Both are needed.

**Next.js 16 compatibility note:**
- `revalidateTag` in Next.js 16 requires a second `profile` argument. The `invalidateTag(tag)` wrapper in `cache-tags.ts` passes `{}` (empty `CacheLifeConfig`) as the profile, which works for `unstable_cache` entries.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 2 pre-existing warnings in `staff-onboarding/onboarding-form.tsx`)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 79+ app routes compiled

### 2026-05-15 — Claude (PERF-PHASE4-001 — Offline / Poor Connectivity Resilience)

**Task:** Phase 4 — Protect all write-path flows from silent failures when the device has no connectivity.

**Files Created:**
- `src/hooks/use-network-status.ts` — `useNetworkStatus()` hook using `useSyncExternalStore` (React 18) to subscribe to `navigator.onLine` / `online` / `offline` events. Returns `{ isOnline, isOffline, wasOffline, lastChangedAt }`. Server snapshot returns `true` (assume online). No hydration mismatch.
- `src/components/shared/offline-banner.tsx` — `"use client"` fixed-position banner (`z-index: 9999`). Two states: offline (dark charcoal, `WifiOff` icon, `aria-live="assertive"`) and back-online (dark green, `aria-live="polite"`). Renders nothing when connectivity never changed.
- `docs/audits/OFFLINE_RESILIENCE_PLAN.md` — Full implementation plan documenting each target, what was protected, what was intentionally excluded, and next steps.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` — Imports and renders `<OfflineBanner />` inside the outer flex container (renders before Sidebar + Header).
- `src/app/(public)/layout.tsx` — Imports and renders `<OfflineBanner />` before `<SiteHeader>`.
- `src/components/public/booking-wizard.tsx` — Added `useNetworkStatus()`. `handleSubmit` early-returns with "You're offline. Check your connection and try again." when `isOffline`. "Confirm Booking" button `disabled={!canProceed || submitting || isOffline}`. Network-error server responses show retry-friendly message.
- `src/components/features/dashboard/booking-action-menu.tsx` — Added `useNetworkStatus()`. `handleAction` short-circuits when `isOffline`, sets inline feedback with retry message. Trigger button disabled when offline. Action failure copy includes "Check your connection and try again."
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/booking-progress-actions.tsx` — Added `useNetworkStatus()`. `handleAdvance` early-returns when `isPending || isOffline`. Both action buttons (advance + no-show) disabled when offline. Cursor/opacity styles updated.

**Components NOT changed (low priority, covered by banner):**
- `staff-weekly-hours-editor.tsx`, `branch-services-panel.tsx`, `reconciliation-form.tsx`, `waitlist-queue.tsx`, `onboarding-form.tsx`

**`public/sw.js`:** Confirmed self-unregistering — no changes made.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 2 pre-existing warnings in `staff-onboarding/onboarding-form.tsx`)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 79 routes

### 2026-05-18 — Claude (UI-STAFF-EDIT-001)

**Task:** Manager Staff Approval Page — compact redesign with Sheet-based service picker

**Problem solved:** The previous staff edit page rendered all service chips at once (CradleHub has 50–100+ services across categories). This caused visual overload and made the page feel like a raw admin form.

**Solution:** Two-phase UX — main page shows a summary, detailed editing opens in a Sheet.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/staff/staff-service-editor-sheet.tsx` — Sheet-based service capability editor. Collapsible category rows (accordion, one open at a time). Each category shows "N selected / M total". Expanded rows: selected chips first, then unselected, max 8 per category with "Show more". Search mode: bypass accordion, show all matching grouped. Filter chips: "All services" / "Selected (N)". Quick actions per category: Select all, Clear. `aria-pressed` on service chips for accessibility.
- (rewrite) `src/components/features/staff/staff-approval-workspace.tsx` — Orchestrator + focused sub-components in one file: `PageHeader` (back link, avatar, name, status badge, dirty indicator), `DraftRestoreBanner` (localStorage restore offer), `StaffInformationCard` (3-col compact grid: name spans full width, others pair up), `ServiceSummaryCard` (count + up to 6 preview chips + "+X more" + "Edit services" button), `ApprovalSummaryPanel` (sticky right: branch/role/job/tier/status/services rows with change markers, service message green/orange, internal tier note, Approve & Activate / Save / Discard actions). Draft includes `isActive`. Lazy `useState` initializers read localStorage without `setState-in-effect`.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/staff/[staffId]/page.tsx` — maxWidth 760→1100, removed PageHeader+StaffEditForm, uses StaffApprovalWorkspace

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 80 routes

### 2026-05-20 - Codex (BOOKING-HOME-SERVICES-001 - Public Home Service Availability)

**Task:** Fixed public booking home-service availability mismatch.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/queries/branches.ts` - corrected the public booking branch-service query to read the same Home/Public branch-service source of truth used by admin service management, while preserving legacy fallbacks.
- `src/app/api/public/booking-context/route.ts` - preserved branch-specific custom duration in public booking service payloads.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/branches/actions.ts` - updated service visibility writes to use current `visibility` first, with a legacy `booking_visibility` fallback.
- `src/lib/cache/cache-tags.ts` - changed branch-service cache invalidation to expire immediately after service setting changes.
- `src/types/supabase.ts` - synced local `branch_services` metadata fields with the live schema used by booking/admin queries.
- `eslint.config.mjs`, `.gitignore` - ignored Codex artifact output so temporary verification files do not get linted or shown as untracked source.
- `.context/CURRENT_TASK.cmd.md`, `.context/HANDOFF.cmd.md`, `.context/ERRORS.cmd.md`, `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md` - updated project context and handoff notes.

**Notes:**
- Public booking now shows Home-enabled Public services for the selected branch.
- In-spa filtering, active-service filtering, branch scope, public visibility, branch price, branch duration, provider/date/payment/confirmation flow, and UI layout were preserved.
- No dummy services or hardcoded service names were added.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: Passing.
- `pnpm lint`: Passing.
- `pnpm build`: Passing, 80 routes.
- Public API smoke confirmed 6 Home-eligible public services and 3 non-Home services for the Cradle branch.
- Public `/book` smoke returned HTTP 200 OK.

### 2026-05-20 — Codex (BOOKING-MOBILE-SERVICE-GRID-001 — Mobile Booking Service Grid Patch)

**Task:** Patch the public booking wizard service selection UI so mobile service cards remain in a compact responsive grid with no page-level horizontal overflow.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/public/booking-service-picker.tsx`
  - Added stricter mobile card/grid containment (`w-full`, `min-w-0`, `max-w-full`, `overflow-hidden`).
  - Kept the compact image-top mobile card with `aspect-[4/3]`, responsive `next/image` sizes, and meaningful service alt text.
  - Constrained mobile category chip and loading skeleton rows so only the chip row scrolls horizontally.
  - Preserved live service data, category filtering, selected service state, and desktop card layout.
- `src/components/public/booking-wizard.tsx`
  - Added public mobile `w-full max-w-full overflow-x-hidden` wrappers.
  - Added `min-w-0` to the wizard content grid/main column to avoid layout-induced horizontal scroll.
  - Preserved booking flow logic, sticky/fixed action controls, desktop layout, and the floating circular widget.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: Passing.
- `pnpm lint`: Passing.
- `pnpm build`: Passing, 80 routes.
- Browser smoke test on `/book`: 360px -> 2-column grid, 390px/430px -> 3-column grid, 520px -> 4-column grid, 768px/desktop -> desktop layout, all with document-level horizontal overflow `0`.

### 2026-05-18 — Claude (BOOKING-PROVIDER-001 — Smart Provider Selection)

**Task:** Improve booking wizard provider selection so staff are filtered by service, shown as a premium photo grid, and auto-assigned when only one qualified provider is available.

**Problem solved:** The provider step always showed a 2-column initials-avatar grid regardless of how many (or few) providers were qualified. Services with only one qualified provider forced customers to make a trivial "choice." No photos were shown even though staff have `avatar_url` on record.

**Logic (3-case):**
1. **0 providers**: "Any available provider" card + dashed fallback note.
2. **1 provider**: Auto-assigned. Booking card shows provider name, photo, "Available and assigned for you." Customer can tap "Use any available provider instead" (sets `"prefer-auto"` sentinel) to opt out.
3. **2+ providers**: "Any available provider" (Recommended) card on top, then 4-column (2-column mobile) photo grid below. First provider gets a "Recommended" ribbon.

**State model (no useEffect):**
- `selectedStaff: "auto" | "prefer-auto" | staffId` — three semantic values
- `selectedStaffForBooking` useMemo resolves: `"prefer-auto"` → `"auto"`, specific id → validate still available, default `"auto"` + single provider → provider id
- No `setState` inside effects; no cascading renders.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/api/public/booking-context/route.ts` — Added `nickname` and `avatar_url` to primary select string and response mapping; extended `isMissingStaffOrgColumnsError` guard; added `nickname: null` / `avatar_url: null` to legacy fallback map.
- `src/components/public/booking-wizard.tsx` — `BookingContextStaff`, `StaffLookup`, `StaffOption` types updated with `avatarUrl`; `staffAtSlot()` prefers `nickname` over `name` as display; lookup build populates `avatarUrl`; `selectedStaffForBooking` handles 3-case auto-select logic; removed unused `STAFF_TYPE_LABELS` / `StaffType` imports; new `ProviderPhotoCard` component (photo/initials, recommended ribbon, selection ring); `StepTherapist` redesigned with 3 distinct cases; booking summary label updated to "Any available provider".

### 2026-05-18 — Claude (UI-WARNING-FRAMEWORK-001 — System-Wide Actionable Warning Framework)

**Task:** Create a reusable warning system so every warning in CradleHub is clickable and answers: what is wrong / why it matters / where to fix it / what happens on click.

**Problem solved:** Ad-hoc inline warning divs scattered across the app were non-interactive, had inconsistent styling, and gave no guidance on how to fix the issue. Managers had to navigate manually after seeing a warning.

**Architecture:**
- Type-discriminated `WarningActionType` drives a unified click handler: `scroll` → DOM smooth-scroll, `focus` → DOM focus+scroll, `navigate` → `router.push`, `open-panel`/`modal`/`custom` → `onAction(warning)` callback.
- Severity palette (danger/warning/success/info) matches all existing inline divs exactly — visual parity guaranteed.
- `warningTargets` factory pattern: pre-built targets for every known context (staff, scheduling, branches, services, bookings, dispatch, notifications, settings). Import only what you need; tree-shaking removes the rest.
- `compact` mode: collapses icon + description + impact to just title + action button for dense list contexts.

**Files Created:**
- `src/types/warnings.ts` — Core types: `WarningSeverity`, `WarningActionType`, `ActionableWarningTarget` (discriminated union of 6 types), `ActionableWarning`
- `src/lib/warnings/scroll-to-target.ts` — DOM helpers: `scrollToElement(id)`, `focusElement(id)`, `buildHref(href, tab?, query?)` (SSR-safe with `typeof window === "undefined"` guards)
- `src/lib/warnings/action-targets.ts` — `warningTargets` const object: 25+ factory functions covering all known CradleHub contexts (staff workspace, scheduling, branches, services, bookings, dispatch, notifications, settings, generic scroll/focus/custom)
- `src/components/shared/actionable-warning.tsx` — `ActionableWarning` card component. Severity-themed. Lucide icon wrapped in `<span>` (type-safe). `→` chevron on navigate targets. `aria-label` on action button, `role="alert|status"` on container.
- `src/components/shared/actionable-warning-list.tsx` — `ActionableWarningList` vertical stack. Renders nothing when empty.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/features/staff/staff-approval-workspace.tsx` — Reference integration: replaced 7 inline warning divs with `ActionableWarning` (protected-account danger, zero-services warning, missing-services info in ServiceSummaryCard; awaiting-approval, services warning/success, draft-saved success, save-result in ApprovalSummaryPanel). Added `id="approval-actions"` for scroll target. Added `onAction` prop to `ApprovalSummaryPanel` and wired `panelId === "service-editor"` → `setIsSheetOpen(true)`.

### 2026-05-18 — Claude (BOOKING-SERVICES-001 — Premium Image-Card Services Step)

**Task:** Replace the text-card service list in the public booking wizard with portrait image cards grouped by category.

**Problem solved:** The services step rendered each service as a flat horizontal text row — functional but low-premium. The new design uses 4/5-aspect-ratio portrait photo cards with spa imagery, dark gradient overlays, and a +/✓ selection indicator — consistent with the ProviderPhotoCard aesthetic from BOOKING-PROVIDER-001.

**Design:**
- **Card**: `button` with `aspectRatio: "4/5"`, `next/image fill`, `object-cover`, `group-hover:scale-105`
- **Gradient**: `from-black/80 via-black/20 to-black/10` (bottom-heavy for text legibility)
- **Selection ring**: golden (`ring-[#C8A96B]`) when selected, neutral when not; +/✓ indicator top-right
- **Text panel** pinned to bottom: service name (line-clamp-2), duration faded left, price in gold right
- **Images**: category-name keyword mapping to `SPA_IMAGES` constants (no per-service DB column)

**Architecture:**
- `CATEGORY_IMAGE_KEYWORDS` array — ordered keyword list maps category name substrings to `SPA_IMAGES` paths
- `getCategoryImage(categoryName)` — pure function, first-match wins, falls back to `SPA_IMAGES.booking`
- `ServiceImageCard` — self-contained sub-component, receives pre-resolved `categoryImage`
- All grouping, category sidebar, selection toggle, totals, visit-type filtering: unchanged
- Loading skeleton updated to `grid grid-cols-2` with `aspect-ratio: 4/5` skeletons

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/public/booking-service-picker.tsx` — full rewrite of card rendering; logic layer untouched

### 2026-05-20 — Claude (STAFF-MOTION-001 — Premium Micro-Animations for Staff Portal Booking Progress Actions)

**Task:** Add tiny premium interaction feedback to the existing staff portal booking progress actions without changing the booking lifecycle, business logic, or UI layout.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/shared/motion/premium-action-overlay.tsx` — reusable full-screen cream translucent overlay with forest-green spinner and short action title/description; shown while a server action is in-flight.
- `src/components/shared/motion/premium-success-toast.tsx` — fixed bottom-center slide-up toast for success (green), warning (amber, used for no-show), and error (red) feedback; auto-dismissed by parent via setTimeout.
- `src/components/shared/motion/premium-inline-spinner.tsx` — 13px circular spinner with white borders for use inside the green primary action button.
- `src/components/shared/motion/live-pulse-indicator.tsx` — small animated pulse dot + label; used when booking is in `travel_started` (green) or `session_started` (gold) states.
- `src/components/shared/motion/motion-status-dot.tsx` — animated status dot replacing the plain colored span in the compact stepper: done=green, active=gold pulse, pending=muted, warning=amber.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/booking-progress-actions.tsx` — added `actionFeedback` state, `getProgressFeedback()` helper, `PremiumActionOverlay` during server action, `PremiumSuccessToast`/error toast replacing `alert()`, inline spinner in buttons, `active:scale-[0.98]` press effect, `MotionStatusDot` in stepper, `LivePulseIndicator` next to timers for active travel/session states.
- `src/app/globals.css` — appended four named keyframes: `cradle-premium-pulse` (pulse ring for active dots), `cradle-soft-slide-up` (toast entrance), `cradle-check-pop` (icon pop-in), `cradle-card-glow` (ambient glow, available for future use).

**Notes:**
- No booking lifecycle logic was changed. `progress.ts` and `actions.ts` are untouched.
- No UI redesign: card layouts, desktop/mobile split, and booking card structure unchanged.
- No new npm packages installed. Animations use Tailwind `animate-spin` and custom CSS keyframes only.
- Existing staff portal flow (home-service and in-spa lifecycles, no-show) remains intact.

### 2026-05-20 — Claude (CRM-NAV-001 — CRM Services Access + Nav Fixes)

**Task:** CRM and CSR Head roles were missing the Services page in their workspace. Fixed role guards, created the CRM services route, expanded branch-action authorization, and corrected a duplicate nav item.

**Files Created:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/services/page.tsx` — CRM-scoped services page using same `ServicesOfferedTab` component as manager, but with `CRM_SERVICE_ROLES` set (owner, manager, assistant_manager, store_manager, crm, csr_head); redirects to `/crm` on unauthorized.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/branches/actions.ts` — `requireOwnerOrBranchManager()` now includes `crm` and `csr_head` roles; added `revalidatePath("/manager/services")` and `revalidatePath("/crm/services")` to `removeBranchServiceAction`, `addBranchServiceAction`, and `updateBranchServiceEligibilityAction`.
- `src/components/features/dashboard/nav-config.ts` — added `{ label: "Services", href: "/crm/services", icon: "Sparkles" }` to `CRM_NAV_ITEMS` and `CSR_HEAD_NAV_ITEMS`; removed duplicate "My Schedule" from `STAFF_NAV_ITEMS`.

### 2026-05-20 — Claude (MANAGER-STAFF-AVAILABILITY-001 — Manager Staff Availability Setup Page)

**Task:** Create a production-ready manager page for setting weekly working hours, day overrides, day off, and blocked time per staff member. The booking engine already respects `staff_schedules`, `schedule_overrides`, and `blocked_times` — this page exposes management of those tables to the manager.

**Route:** `/manager/staff-availability`

**Files Created:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/staff-availability/page.tsx` — Server component. Uses `getManagerBranchId()` for auth, `getStaffWithAvailability(branchId)` for data, renders `PageHeader` + `StaffSchedulePageClient`. Shows `Alert` on load error.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/queries/staff.ts` — added `StaffAvailabilityItem` type, `buildAvailabilityItems()` helper (parallel fetch of schedules/overrides/blocked_times for all branch staff), and `getStaffWithAvailability(branchId)` export. Includes graceful fallback for older DB schemas missing `staff_type`/`is_head`/`nickname` columns. Fetches overrides and blocked times scoped to next 90 days.
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/staff-weekly-hours-editor.tsx` — added optional `onSave?: () => void` prop; called after successful schedule save.
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/staff-day-overrides-editor.tsx` — added optional `onSave?: () => void` prop; called after successful override save.
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/staff-block-time-editor.tsx` — added optional `onSave?: () => void` prop; called after successful blocked-time save.
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/staff-schedule-detail-panel.tsx` — added `onSave?: () => void` prop; threaded down to each editor tab.
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/staff-schedule-page-client.tsx` — wired `PremiumSuccessToast` (from existing motion library) to fire when any editor tab saves; toast shows staff member's name and auto-dismisses after 3.5 s. Added `useCallback` for `handleSave`.
- `src/components/features/dashboard/nav-config.ts` — added `{ label: "Availability", href: "/manager/staff-availability", icon: "CalendarClock" }` to `MANAGER_NAV_ITEMS` (after "Staff").
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/staff/actions.ts` — all four server actions (`setStaffScheduleAction`, `createScheduleOverrideAction`, `deleteBlockedTimeAction`, `deleteScheduleOverrideAction`) now also call `revalidatePath("/manager/staff-availability")`.

**Design decisions:**
- Route at `/manager/staff-availability` (not `/manager/staff/schedule`) to avoid route conflict with `/manager/staff/[staffId]` dynamic segment.
- All staff in branch visible (active and inactive) so manager can set availability before re-activating staff.
- Editors keep existing inline inline-banner feedback for immediate response; `PremiumSuccessToast` adds a global confirmation at the page level.
- No DB schema changes. No new npm packages. Booking lifecycle logic untouched.

### 2026-05-20 — Codex (SCHEDULE-ADJUSTMENT-001 — Manual Staff Schedule Adjustment)

**Task:** Added a compact manual staff schedule adjustment control to the existing Manager/CRM schedule workflow.

**Files Created:**
- `src/lib/actions/staff-schedule-adjustments.ts` — shared `adjustStaffScheduleAction` with RBAC, branch scope, date override/block CRUD, and schedule/bookings/booking-page revalidation.
- `src/components/features/schedule/manual-staff-schedule-adjustment.tsx` — compact staff-mode adjustment UI for custom hours, day off, block time, clear override, and remove block.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-workspace.tsx` — added schedule-adjustment toast feedback and refresh after successful adjustments.
- `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-board-panel.tsx` — threaded adjustment feedback into staff view mode.
- `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-staff-mode.tsx` — added the manual adjustment section below the selected staff summary.
- `src/lib/queries/schedule.ts` — enriched daily schedule rows with current date override and real blocked-time IDs for safe removal.
- `src/lib/permissions.ts` — added `canAdjustStaffSchedule()` for owner/manager/assistant manager/store manager/CRM/CSR head schedule edits.
- `.context/CURRENT_TASK.cmd.md`, `.context/HANDOFF.cmd.md`, `.context/ERRORS.cmd.md`, `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` — updated agent context.

**Notes:**
- Manager/CRM can now adjust one staff member's availability from `/manager/schedule` and `/crm/schedule` staff mode.
- Weekly schedules remain intact; custom hours/day off are date-specific overrides.
- Booking availability and assignment continue to use the existing availability engine, which already prioritizes overrides/blocks before weekly schedules.
- No database schema changes, new packages, UI redesign, or scheduling engine rewrite.

### 2026-05-21 — Claude Code

**Task:** CRM-OPS-001 — Exposed categorized CRM operations navbar and fixed CRM landing route

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/dashboard/nav-config.ts` — Added `NavGroup` type; replaced flat `CRM_NAV_ITEMS`, `CSR_HEAD_NAV_ITEMS`, `CSR_STAFF_NAV_ITEMS` with grouped nav configs using 5 operational categories
- `src/components/features/dashboard/sidebar.tsx` — Extracted `NavLink` helper, added grouped nav rendering (renders category labels + items when `nav.groups` is set; falls back to flat `nav.items` for owner/manager/staff — no breaking changes), added `CalendarClock` to icon map
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/page.tsx` — Changed CRM landing redirect from `/crm/today` to `/crm/control`

**CRM Nav Categories Added:**
1. Main Operations — Control, Live Map, Dispatch, Bookings, Schedule, Availability
2. Customer Management — Customers, Repeats, Lapsed, Waitlist
3. Service & Resource Setup — Services, Spaces
4. Staff & Internal Work — Staff Applications, Notifications
5. Finance / End-of-day — Reconciliation

**Design Decisions:**
- Used existing route paths (`/crm/live-operations`, `/crm/staff-availability`, `/crm/spaces-rules`) with cleaner display labels to avoid unnecessary redirect pages
- Grouped nav only applies to CRM roles; owner/manager/staff remain flat (backward compatible)
- `NavGroup` type added to `WorkspaceNav`; `items` made optional so the type supports both flat and grouped configs

**Roadmap Items Completed:** Phase 1 CRM operations navigation stabilization

**Notes:** Worked directly on `main`; no branch/worktree created. All 15 required CRM pages already existed — no placeholder pages needed. No scheduling/dispatch business logic changed. No new packages installed. No database or RLS changes.

**Build Status:** ✅ Passing — 83 app routes

**Design Decisions:**
- All stats are computed from real `items` prop — no fake data.
- Existing `StaffScheduleDetailPanel` sheet editor is untouched.
- Filter pills are clickable buttons with active/hover states matching CradleHub sand theme.
- Status chips use existing `--cs-success`, `--cs-neutral`, `--cs-error` tokens.

  - Add-block form in a rounded white card with labeled fields
  - Reason select with custom arrow
  - Block list items as cards with colored reason badge, date circle, formatted date
  - Remove button with Trash icon
  - Empty state with centered icon

**Design Decisions:**

- Feedback alerts use CradleHub theme tokens (`--cs-success-bg`, `--cs-error-bg`) instead of hardcoded hex colors.
- Editors wrapped in `var(--cs-surface)` white cards with `var(--cs-border-soft)` borders.
- Sheet inner background uses `var(--cs-surface-warm)` for warmth.
- Tabs use existing `Tabs` component with `variant="line"` and sand accent.

### 2026-05-21 — Claude Code (CRM-OPS-002I — Driver/Therapist Assignment Recommendation)

**Task:** Add recommendation engine that helps CRM choose the best available staff for bookings.

**Files Created:**
- `src/lib/assignments/recommendation-engine.ts` — Pure scoring logic for therapist and driver candidates
  - `scoreTherapistCandidates()` — scores service providers by check-in, conflicts, capability, schedule fit, workload
  - `scoreDriverCandidates()` — scores drivers by check-in, active trips, schedule fit, workload
  - Transparent scoring: +40 checked in, +30 no conflict, +20 same branch/service-capable, +15 inside shift, +10 light workload, -50 not checked in/conflict, -30 blocked/day off, -20 no schedule
- `src/lib/queries/assignment-recommendations.ts` — Query layer that fetches all recommendation context in parallel
  - Booking, service, staff list, staff_services, schedules, overrides, blocked times, check-ins, conflict bookings, preferences
- `src/lib/actions/assignment-recommendations.ts` — Server actions
  - `getAssignmentRecommendationsAction()` — full therapist + driver recommendations
  - `getTherapistRecommendationsAction()` — therapist only
  - `getDriverRecommendationsAction()` — driver only (home service only)
  - Branch-scoped with owner cross-branch bypass
- `src/components/features/assignments/assignment-recommendation-card.tsx` — Single candidate card
  - Status badge (recommended/available/warning/unavailable), score, reasons, warnings, assign button
- `src/components/features/assignments/assignment-recommendation-panel.tsx` — Expandable panel
  - "Get Recommendations" button, best match + alternatives, loading/error states

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/bookings/bookings-table.tsx`
  - Added `BookingRecommendationSection` inside `BookingDetailsPanel`
  - Shows therapist recommendations when staff is unassigned
  - Shows driver recommendations for home-service bookings
  - Wires existing `assignBookingDriverAction` for driver assign
  - Shows "Recommendation only" note for therapist (no existing assign action in panel)
- `src/components/features/dispatch/dispatch-workspace.tsx`
  - Added driver recommendation panel inside expanded `DispatchItemRow` when `dispatchStatus === "awaiting_driver"`
  - Wires existing `assignBookingDriverAction`

**Design Decisions:**
- Recommendation-only: no auto-assignment. CRM must still click existing assign/confirm controls.
- Therapist assignment in booking panel is recommendation-only because no existing "assign therapist to booking" UI action exists in the detail panel (assignment happens during booking creation via seniority auto-assign or edit booking flow).
- Driver assignment uses the existing `assignBookingDriverAction` server action.
- Group schedule rules exist but are not integrated into the recommendation engine's schedule check yet (uses `staff_schedules` directly, same as availability engine).
- `staff_scheduling_preferences` is queried but not yet used in scoring (graceful fallback if table absent).

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 84 app routes

**Commit:** `feat(assignments): add staff recommendation engine` on `main`

### 2026-05-21 — Claude Code (Phase 2X-A — Operations Unification Audit)

**Task:** CRM-OPS-002X-A — Audit the entire operations workflow for duplication, broken links, and missing integration points.

**Files Changed:**
- `docs/phase-2x-operations-unification-audit.md` — Created: full audit document
- `.context/CURRENT_TASK.cmd.md` — Updated to 2X-A
- `.context/HANDOFF.cmd.md` — Updated with audit findings and 2X-B+ plan

**Key Findings:**
- CRITICAL: `staff_group_schedule_rules` is ignored by all 5 operational schedule consumers (booking engine, recommendation engine, daily schedule RPC, CRM availability, individual editor). Group rules have zero effect on bookings.
- HIGH: `manager/staff-availability` diverged from `crm/staff-availability` — still uses legacy `StaffSchedulePageClient` while CRM has full Phase 2E `ScheduleSetupWorkspace`.
- MEDIUM: `fmt12h()` duplicated in `dispatch-queries.ts` and `dispatch-workspace.tsx`. Shift badge constants in 4 files. Presence badge in 2 files.
- MEDIUM: `/crm/schedule`, `/manager/schedule`, `/owner/schedule` each inline identical auth context setup code.
- LOW: Double booking fetch in `buildDriverRecommendationContext`. 5 separate N+1 staff ID queries in recommendation context builder.

**No code behavior was changed in this audit.**

**Verification:**
- No build needed (docs-only commit)

**Commit:** `docs(ops): audit workflow unification gaps` on `main`

### 2026-05-21 — Claude Code (Phase 2X-B — Shared UI Component Consolidation)

**Task:** CRM-OPS-002X-B — Consolidate duplicated shared UI components for schedule, availability, and dispatch.

**Files Created:**
- `src/lib/utils/time-format.ts` — `formatTime12h()` — null-safe 12h time formatter
- `src/components/shared/shift-type-badge.tsx` — `ShiftTypeBadge` (opening/closing/single with CradleHub theme colors)
- `src/components/shared/presence-status-badge.tsx` — `PresenceStatusBadge` (pill variant)
- `src/components/shared/availability-status-badge.tsx` — `AvailabilityStatusBadge` (dot + label variant)

**Files Updated (duplicates removed):**
- `crm-availability-board.tsx` — removed `SHIFT_BADGE`, `ShiftBadge`, `PresenceBadge`, `formatTime` (4 local defs)
- `crm-availability-client.tsx` — removed `SHIFT_BADGE`, `STATUS_DOT`, `STATUS_LABEL`, `PresencePill`, `formatTime` (5 local defs)
- `staff-schedule-row.tsx` — removed `SHIFT_BADGE_COLORS` + local `ShiftBadge`
- `group-schedule-rules-panel.tsx` — removed local `shortTime()`
- `staff-schedule-summary.ts` — removed private `shortTime()`; now imports `formatTime12h`
- `dispatch-workspace.tsx` — removed local `fmt12h()`
- `dispatch-queries.ts` — removed local `fmt12h()` (UI formatting no longer in server query file)

**No business logic changed. No schema changed. Public booking untouched.**

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, all routes compiled

**Commit:** `refactor(ui): consolidate schedule and availability badges` on `main`

### 2026-05-21 — Claude Code (CRM-OPS-002X-F — Manager Schedule Setup Parity)

**Task:** Make `/manager/staff-availability` use the same full `ScheduleSetupWorkspace` as `/crm/staff-availability`.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/staff-availability/page.tsx` — Rewritten to match CRM page
  - Now imports `ScheduleSetupWorkspace` instead of `StaffSchedulePageClient`
  - Fetches `getScheduleSetupOverview()` in parallel with `getStaffWithAvailability()`
  - Passes `items`, `groups`, `rulesByGroup` to `ScheduleSetupWorkspace`
  - Uses same `PageActions` placeholder buttons as CRM
  - Same title "Schedule Setup" and description
  - Same error handling pattern

**What did NOT change:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/staff-availability/page.tsx` — untouched
- `ScheduleSetupWorkspace` component — no changes needed (already role-agnostic)
- `StaffSchedulePageClient` — still used inside `ScheduleSetupWorkspace` for Individual Adjustments tab
- Branch scoping — still uses `getManagerBranchId()`
- Security — no role guards weakened

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 84 app routes

**Commit:** `refactor(schedule): align manager schedule setup workspace` on `main`

### 2026-05-21 — Claude Code (CRM-OPS-002X-G — Dead Code / Legacy Cleanup)

**Task:** Remove proven unused legacy schedule components after Manager and CRM aligned on `ScheduleSetupWorkspace`.

**Files Deleted:**
- `src/components/features/schedule/staff-schedule-grid.tsx` — **336 lines, completely unreferenced.** Legacy schedule grid component. Not imported by any page, component, or utility. Exported `StaffScheduleGrid` had zero external references.
- `src/components/features/dashboard/schedule-manager.tsx` — **569 lines, completely unreferenced.** Legacy standalone schedule manager that imported old server actions from `@/app/(dashboard)/manager/staff/actions`. Replaced by the newer `staff-schedule-detail-panel.tsx` + `staff-weekly-hours-editor.tsx` + `staff-day-overrides-editor.tsx` + `staff-block-time-editor.tsx` stack. Not imported anywhere.

**What was NOT deleted (intentionally kept):**
- `StaffSchedulePageClient` — still used inside `ScheduleSetupWorkspace` (Individual Adjustments tab).
- `StaffScheduleToolbar` — still used inside `StaffSchedulePageClient`.
- `StaffScheduleDetailPanel` — still used inside `StaffSchedulePageClient`.
- `QUICK_ACTIONS` array in `schedule-setup-right-rail.tsx` — still rendered as user-visible placeholder UI.
- `fmt12h` in `dispatch-queries.ts` — already removed in prior phase.
- `SHIFT_BADGE` / `PresenceBadge` / `PresencePill` — already removed in prior phases.
- All other `staff-schedule/*.tsx` files — all still referenced by at least one consumer.
- `today-kpi-row.tsx`, `customer-create-form.tsx`, `customer-search.tsx`, `role-badge.tsx`, `notification-card.tsx`, `scheduling-rules-form.tsx`, `service-card-skeleton.tsx` — outside Phase 2X-G scope.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 84 app routes

**Commit:** `refactor(ops): remove legacy schedule cleanup` on `main`

### 2026-05-21 — Claude Code (CRM-OPS-002X-H — End-to-End Operations Smoke Test)

**Task:** Verify the full operational workflow from public booking to CRM operations. Test and document results. Apply only small safe fixes.

**Smoke Test Document:**
- `docs/phase-2x-h-end-to-end-smoke-test.md` — Full report with executive summary, build verification, per-route results, gaps, bugs, fixes, and production readiness assessment.

**Critical Bug Found & Fixed:**
- `src/lib/actions/online-booking.ts` — Notification `Promise.all` after booking insert could throw, causing the catch block to return `{ ok: false }` even though the booking already existed in the database. User would see a failure message but the slot was actually taken.
  - **Fix:** Wrapped notification `Promise.all` in a dedicated `try/catch` so notification failures are logged via `logBookingError` but never fail the already-committed booking.

**Medium Bugs Found & Fixed:**
- `src/components/features/bookings/bookings-table.tsx` — Driver assignment in `BookingRecommendationSection` was fire-and-forget (no `await`, no `router.refresh()`). UI stayed showing "No driver assigned" after clicking Assign.
  - **Fix:** Added `async/await` + `router.refresh()` to `onAssignDriver` callback.
- `src/components/features/dispatch/dispatch-workspace.tsx` — Same fire-and-forget driver assignment bug in `DispatchItemRow`.
  - **Fix:** Extracted `DispatchRecommendationPanel` component with `async/await` + `router.refresh()`.

**Minor Fix Applied:**
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/staff-schedule-page.tsx` + `src/app/(dashboard)/staff-portal/schedule/page.tsx` — Removed unused `rawBlocks` prop and `BlockedTimeRow` type import.

**Deferred Issues (documented in smoke test report):**
1. Group schedule `shift_type` not reflected in CRM Live Availability check-in — staff with group rules but no individual schedule get `shift_type: "single"` for check-in, which may not match their group rule.
2. Recommendation engine does not use `max_services_per_day` / `max_trips_per_day` from `staff_scheduling_preferences`.
3. Driver ETA/travel distance not factored into driver recommendations.

**Build Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 84 app routes

**Commit:** `fix(ops): resolve smoke test blockers` on `main`

### 2026-05-24 — Claude Code (CRM Operations Setup Center)

**Task:** CRM-OPS-003 — Build unified CRM Operations Setup Center

**Audit Findings:**
- 20 existing CRM pages covering all operational areas
- Nav already grouped into 5 logical sections (Main Ops, Customer Mgmt, Service & Resource Setup, Staff & Internal Work, Finance)
- All individual setup pages exist: schedule, availability, services, spaces-rules, dispatch, control, live-operations
- Key gap: no unified "operational health" view — CRM must navigate multiple pages to understand what's misconfigured
- Key gap: no "Setup Issues" checklist — no way to see broken configuration at a glance

**Files Created:**
- `src/lib/queries/crm-setup.ts` — `getCrmSetupHealth()` query: checks service staff schedules, staff_services assignments, booking rules, resources, drivers, unassigned bookings
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/setup/page.tsx` — Operations Setup Center page (`/crm/setup`)
- `src/components/features/crm/setup/crm-setup-health-cards.tsx` — 6 health status cards (ready/warning/error/info)
- `src/components/features/crm/setup/crm-setup-issues-list.tsx` — actionable issues checklist (severity-sorted, linked to fix pages)
- `src/components/features/crm/setup/crm-setup-workspace-tiles.tsx` — tiles navigating to existing setup pages (no duplication of logic)

**Files Updated:**
- `src/components/features/dashboard/nav-config.ts` — added "Ops Setup" link to CRM and CSR Head "Service & Resource Setup" nav groups
- `src/app/(dashboard)/dev/page.tsx` — added /crm/setup to CRM section in dev panel

**Architecture Decisions Followed:**
- DEC-CRM-001: Used existing route paths — no redirect indirection
- DEC-CRM-002: Grouped nav only for CRM roles — not touched for other workspaces
- No business logic duplicated — all existing queries/pages reused via links
- SERVICE_STAFF_TYPES constant used to filter service-providing staff (therapist, nail_tech, aesthetician, salon_head)
- day_of_week: 0=Sunday (JS getDay() convention, matches staff_schedules DB column)

**What the Setup Center Checks:**
1. Service staff with individual schedule rows (for today's day_of_week)
2. Active branch services with at least one staff_services assignment
3. Active branch_resources count
4. Whether custom branch_booking_rules exist (vs system defaults)
5. Home service enabled + drivers available
6. Unassigned confirmed bookings for today

**Build Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 85 app routes (added /crm/setup)

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-SAFE-TWEAKS-001 — CRM Safe Usability Tweaks)

**Task:** CRM safe usability tweaks before full CRM setup redesign.
Phase 1 only — small, regression-resistant changes. No booking logic changed.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/page.tsx` — changed /crm redirect from /crm/control → /crm/today
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/availability/page.tsx` — clarified live availability vs online booking; notice now explicitly states online booking remains schedule-based and is not controlled by the check-in board
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/bookings/new/page.tsx` — reads `type` query param (walkin | home_service), derives initialVisitType and passes it to BookingWizard; also updates page title/description dynamically
- `src/components/public/booking-wizard.tsx` — added optional `initialVisitType?: VisitType` prop; initializes bookingType state from it (falls back to "in_spa" when omitted — no change to public booking behavior)
- `src/components/features/crm/today/today-quick-actions.tsx` — replaced 4 generic actions with 5 CRM-focused quick actions: New Walk-in, New Home Service, Online Requests, Search Customer, Live Availability
- `src/components/features/crm/today/today-staff-readiness.tsx` — fixed "Full View" link from /crm/staff-availability → /crm/availability
- `src/components/features/dashboard/nav-config.ts` — renamed "Ops Setup" → "Rules & Setup" and "Spaces" → "Spaces & Rules" in CRM_NAV_GROUPS and CSR_HEAD_NAV_GROUPS

**Files NOT Changed (confirmed):**
- src/lib/actions/online-booking.ts — untouched
- src/lib/actions/inhouse-booking.ts — untouched
- src/lib/engine/availability.ts — untouched
- src/lib/engine/resource-availability.ts — untouched
- src/lib/bookings/dispatch-conflict.ts — untouched
- src/lib/bookings/dispatch-slot-filter.ts — untouched
- No database schema changes. No migrations.

**Architecture Note (to carry forward):**
Online booking remains strictly schedule-based.
CRM/in-house booking can use daily staff check-in and live resource readiness.
Home-service booking keeps its dispatch/location workflow.
All three flows share the scheduling/availability engine but apply it differently based on booking context.

**Build Status:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ PASS
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ PASS
- `pnpm build`: ✅ PASS, 85 app routes

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-TODAY-PHASE2-001 — Daily Operations Center UI)

**Task:** Phase 2 CRM Today Daily Operations Center UI organization.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/today/page.tsx` — title changed to "Daily Operations Center"; added TodayWorkflowStrip, "Serve Customers" section label, "Today's Operational Snapshot" section label, TodaySystemMatchStatus, TodayEmergencyActions; retained all existing components
- `src/components/features/crm/today/crm-booking-queue-panel.tsx` — improved empty-state message for active tab
- `src/components/features/crm/today/today-staff-readiness.tsx` — added "Start Day" label and description inside the card
- `src/components/features/crm/today/today-quick-actions.tsx` — removed self-owned marginBottom (now owned by section wrapper)
- `src/components/features/crm/today/today-priority-strip.tsx` — removed self-owned marginBottom (now owned by section wrapper)

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/crm/today/today-workflow-strip.tsx` — visual shift workflow guide (Start Day → Serve Customers → Confirm Bookings → Monitor Operations → Emergency Actions)
- `src/components/features/crm/today/today-system-match-status.tsx` — orientation card linking to 6 operational tools (no new queries, navigation only)
- `src/components/features/crm/today/today-emergency-actions.tsx` — mid-shift action links card (navigation only)

**Notes:**
- Reorganized /crm/today around the daily front-desk workflow.
- Added workflow strip, System Match Status, and Emergency Actions.
- No booking business logic changed.
- Online booking remains schedule-based.
- In-house CRM booking remains live-operations based.
- Home-service workflow remains dispatch/location based.
- No new database queries or schema changes.
- All links in new components point to existing CRM routes — no invented routes.

**Build Status:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ PASS
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ PASS
- `pnpm build`: ✅ PASS, 85 app routes

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-SETUP-PHASE3-001 — Rules & Setup Center)

**Task:** Phase 3 CRM Rules & Setup Center.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/setup/page.tsx` — title changed to "Rules & Setup Center"; Section helper upgraded with description prop; 5-section layout: Booking Flow Rules, Setup Health, Setup Issues, Setup Workspaces, What affects each booking type?; both informational-only sections render even on health-check error; footer updated with online-booking architecture note
- `src/components/features/crm/setup/crm-setup-workspace-tiles.tsx` — TILES array updated to match Phase 3 required 6 workspaces: Services & Therapists, Schedule Setup, Spaces & Rules, Live Availability, Dispatch, Daily Operations Center

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/crm/setup/crm-booking-flow-rules.tsx` — 3-card grid (Online Booking/Schedule-based, In-House/Live operations, Home-Service/Dispatch workflow) with badge, description, and 3 quick links each; informational/navigation only
- `src/components/features/crm/setup/crm-booking-impact-matrix.tsx` — responsive table (overflow-x: auto) with 10 data-factor rows × 3 booking-type columns; ✓/✕/partial-note cells; informational only

**Files Untouched (reused as-is):**
- `src/components/features/crm/setup/crm-setup-health-cards.tsx`
- `src/components/features/crm/setup/crm-setup-issues-list.tsx`
- `src/lib/queries/crm-setup.ts`

**Notes:**
- Converted /crm/setup into Rules & Setup Center.
- Added booking flow rules explanation (3 cards, badges, quick links).
- Added booking impact matrix (10 factors × 3 booking types).
- Preserved existing setup health and setup issues components untouched.
- No booking logic changed.
- Online booking remains schedule-based.
- In-house booking remains live-operations based.
- Home-service remains dispatch/location based.

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-SERVICES-PHASE4-001)

**Task:** Phase 4 — /crm/services → "Services & Therapist Setup"

**Files Added:**
- `src/lib/queries/crm-services.ts` — `getBranchStaffAndServiceAssignments(branchId, serviceIds)`: parallel fetch of active branch staff + staff_services rows for the provider panel
- `src/components/features/crm/services/crm-service-therapist-panel.tsx` — `CrmServiceTherapistPanel`: read-only per-service provider assignment view with warning/critical states

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/services/page.tsx`
  - Title: "Services" → "Services & Therapist Setup" (icon: ✨)
  - Added `isActiveBranchService` type guard
  - Fetches providerStaff + providerAssignments after branch services (non-fatal: panel shows empty if fails)
  - Two sections: Active Services + Provider Assignments

**Key Decisions:**
- Provider Assignments panel is read-only for CRM workspace — assignment editing stays in owner workspace (owner → Staff → [member] → Services tab)
- `SERVICE_STAFF_TYPES = ["therapist", "nail_tech", "aesthetician", "salon_head"]` — only these count as valid providers
- `HARD_EXCLUDED_SYSTEM_ROLES = ["driver", "utility"]` — never shown as providers even if staff_services row exists
- ⛔ critical = public service + 0 valid providers (online booking affected)
- ⚠️ warning = non-public service + 0 valid providers (CRM bookings affected)
- Panel footnote explains the matching rule and links to /owner/staff for edits

**Notes:**
- No booking logic changed. No DB schema changes. No new migrations.
- The `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` tsconfig flag required using inline object fallbacks for Record<string, T> access (not `record[key] ?? record.defaultKey` pattern).

**Build Status:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: ✅ PASS (0 errors)
- Commit: 79dd447

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-SERVICES-PHASE4B-001)

**Task:** Phase 4B — CRM-managed therapist-service assignments with guardrails

**Files Added:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/services/actions.ts`
  - `assignProviderToServiceAction`: role guard → branch scope → service-active → staff-eligible (SERVICE_STAFF_TYPES, HARD_EXCLUDED_SYSTEM_ROLES, is_active) → no-duplicate → inserts staff_services row
  - `removeProviderFromServiceAction`: same guards + last-provider protection (blocks removal that would leave a public active service with 0 valid providers)
  - `requireCrmSetupAccess()`: context helper for CRM_SETUP_ROLES (owner, manager, assistant_manager, store_manager, crm, csr_head)
  - Zod validation for all inputs
  - Revalidates /crm/services, /crm/setup, /crm/today after mutations
- `src/components/features/crm/services/provider-assignment-card.tsx`
  - Client component per service: assign dropdown (pre-filtered to valid/unassigned/active providers only), ✕ remove buttons per chip, inline status feedback, router.refresh() on success
- `src/components/features/crm/services/types.ts`
  - ServiceRow shared type (server panel + client card)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/features/crm/services/crm-service-therapist-panel.tsx`
  - Refactored from client → server component shell
  - Computes ServiceRow[] including assignableProviders per service
  - Renders ProviderAssignmentCard per row
  - MVP access notice added
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/services/page.tsx`
  - Passes branchId prop to CrmServiceTherapistPanel

**Notes:**
- Enabled CRM to assign/remove valid service providers for MVP setup.
- Uses existing staff_services relationship — no duplicate system.
- Validates staff eligibility with SERVICE_STAFF_TYPES and HARD_EXCLUDED_SYSTEM_ROLES.
- Blocks invalid provider roles (drivers, utility, CRM/CSR-only without service staff_type).
- Protects public active services from ending with zero valid providers.
- Assign dropdown excludes: drivers, utility, inactive, already-assigned providers.
- No booking logic changed. Online booking remains schedule-based.
- MVP note: CRM permission is intentionally broad; can be tightened to manager/owner later.
- No database schema changes. No new migrations.

**Build Status:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: ✅ PASS (0 errors)
- `eslint (changed files)`: ✅ PASS (0 warnings)
- Commit: e1c65da

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-AVAILABILITY-PHASE7-001)

**Task:** Phase 7 — /crm/availability → "Live Availability & Check-In Center"

**Files Added:**
- `src/components/features/crm/availability/checkin-explainer.tsx`
  - 3 cards: In-House Operations (amber), Online Booking (blue), Home Service (green)
  - Each card explains the booking flow's relationship to check-in with bullet points
  - Cross-links: Online Booking → Schedule Setup + Spaces & Rules; Home Service → Today
  - Architecture note banner: online booking = schedule-based, not check-in-based
- `src/components/features/crm/availability/start-day-checklist.tsx`
  - 5-step morning readiness checklist (check in arrivals, review missing, confirm drivers,
    check schedule issues, open Today to begin serving)
  - Steps 4 and 5 link to Schedule Setup Center and Daily Operations Center
- `src/components/features/crm/availability/live-availability-impact-card.tsx`
  - "What This Affects" — 4 rows mapping check-in status to each booking flow
  - Online booking: unaffected; In-house + Dispatch: "Uses check-in" badge; Staff readiness: feeds Today
- `src/components/features/crm/availability/availability-related-tools.tsx`
  - 6 footer tool link cards: Today, Schedule Setup, Dispatch, Services, Spaces & Rules, Rules & Setup

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/availability/page.tsx`
  - Title: "Live Availability" → "Live Availability & Check-In Center"
  - Subtitle updated to describe same-day operations scope
  - Added CheckInExplainer after PageHeader
  - Removed old inline check-in awareness notice (explainer covers it more thoroughly)
  - Layout: CheckInExplainer → CrmAvailabilitySummary → CrmAvailabilityClient → StartDayChecklist
    → LiveAvailabilityImpactCard → AvailabilityRelatedTools
  - Added StartDayChecklist, LiveAvailabilityImpactCard, AvailabilityRelatedTools imports

**Notes:**
- All existing check-in / check-out server actions (`checkInStaffForShiftAction`,
  `checkOutStaffForShiftAction`) preserved unchanged.
- `CrmAvailabilityClient` (4-tab board) and `CrmAvailabilitySummary` (7 stat cards)
  preserved exactly as-is — no modifications.
- No booking logic changed. No DB schema changes. No new migrations.
- Online booking remains strictly schedule-based and is unaffected by this board.

**Build Status:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: ✅ PASS (0 errors)
- `eslint (changed files)`: ✅ PASS (0 warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ PASS (85/85 routes)
- Commit: 3375c1f

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-READINESS-PHASE9A-001)

**Task:** Phase 9A — Audit Existing Readiness & Condition Checks

**Files Added:**
- `docs/CRM_READINESS_AUDIT.md`
  - Full codebase audit of all readiness/health/warning/issue/notification logic
  - Section A: Readiness system map (8 CRM pages/features, each with queries, components, data shapes)
  - Section B: All 7 distinct severity/issue type systems with full TypeScript shapes
  - Section C: Reusable component candidates (ActionableWarning, ActionableWarningList as gold standard)
  - Section D: 8 cases of duplicate logic with source-of-truth recommendations
  - Section E: 14 missing condition checks with severity and suggested fix links
  - Section F: Proposed ReadinessIssue + ReadinessSeverity + ReadinessScope canonical types
  - Section G: 7-phase implementation plan (9B–9G)
  - Section H: Do-not-touch files list
  - Section I: Summary table across all CRM pages

**Files Changed:**
- `.context/CURRENT_TASK.cmd.md` — updated to Phase 9A COMPLETE
- `.context/CHANGELOG.cmd.md` — this entry
- `.context/HANDOFF.cmd.md` — Phase 9A summary added

**Key Audit Findings:**
- 7 different severity type systems in use (`"danger"/"error"/"critical"` all mean the same thing but appear in different files)
- `ActionableWarning` in `src/types/warnings.ts` is the most mature shared type and should become the standard
- `getCrmSetupHealth()` in `src/lib/queries/crm-setup.ts` is the only centralized multi-domain aggregator — the model for the future engine
- `CrmSetupIssuesList` is a near-duplicate of `ActionableWarningList` but uses a different data shape
- Staff-no-schedule check appears in 3 independent places; service-no-provider in 2; unassigned bookings in 3
- 14 missing checks identified including: driver-assigned-not-checked-in, home-service-no-therapist, no-opening-shift, ghost-check-in, payment-overdue, booking-no-address

**Notes:**
- No booking logic changed. No DB schema changes. No new migrations.
- No source code files modified — audit document only.

**Build Status:**
- No source changes — build not run (not required)

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-READINESS-PHASE9B-001)

**Task:** Phase 9B — Shared Operations Readiness Types & Components

**Files Added:**
- `src/types/readiness.ts`
  - `ReadinessSeverity` — "critical" | "warning" | "info" | "success"
  - `ReadinessScope` — 8 domains: setup/schedule/daily/service/space/dispatch/payment/system
  - `ReadinessStatus` — "ok" | "warning" | "critical"
  - `ReadinessIssue` — canonical issue shape (id, scope, severity, title, problem, impact, fix, actionLabel, actionHref, source, entityType?, entityIds?, count?)

  - `buildReadinessResult()` — convenience wrapper
  - `READINESS_SCOPE_META` — icon/label map for all 8 scopes
- `src/components/shared/readiness-issue-card.tsx` — Server component
  - Severity icon + badge label, scope badge with icon, count badge (when >1)
  - Full detail: title, problem, impact, fix, action Link
  - Compact mode: title + action only (hides problem/impact/fix, smaller icon)
  - SEVERITY_STYLE record for color/bg/border per severity level
- `src/components/shared/readiness-issue-list.tsx` — Server component
  - Sorts via sortReadinessIssues (critical first)
  - Empty state: green ✅ banner with configurable title/description
  - Optional section header with issue count badge
  - maxItems cap with "+ N more issues not shown" footer
  - compact prop forwarded to each ReadinessIssueCard
- `src/components/shared/readiness-health-grid.tsx` — Server component

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-READINESS-PHASE9C-001)

**Task:** Phase 9C — CRM Operations Readiness Aggregator

**Files Added:**
- `src/lib/queries/crm-readiness.ts`
  - `getCrmReadinessIssues(branchId)` — main aggregator, returns `ReadinessIssue[]`
  - `getCrmReadiness(branchId)` — convenience wrapper, returns `ReadinessResult`
  - `mapSetupIssuesToReadinessIssues()` — maps SetupIssue[] from getCrmSetupHealth
  - `mapStaffReadinessToReadinessIssues()` — maps CrmAvailabilitySummary
  - `mapDispatchStatsToReadinessIssues()` — maps DispatchStats
  - `mapPaymentSummaryToReadinessIssues()` — maps daily payment summary
  - `dedupeReadinessIssues()` — deduplicates by id, keeps highest severity
  - `createSourceFailureIssue()` — emits system:warning when a source fails
  - `mapSetupSeverity()`, `mapSetupScope()`, `deriveSetupFix()` — field mapping helpers

**Existing Checks Mapped:**
  From getCrmSetupHealth (6 issues):
  - no-schedule → setup:no-schedule (schedule / warning)
  - no-staff-for-service → setup:no-staff-for-service (service / critical)
  - no-drivers → setup:no-drivers (dispatch / critical)
  - no-resources → setup:no-resources (space / warning)
  - default-rules → setup:default-rules (setup / info)
  - unassigned-bookings → setup:unassigned-bookings (daily / critical)
  From getCrmTodaySnapshot (5 issues):
  - notCheckedIn → availability:not-checked-in (daily / warning)
  - needsAttention → availability:needs-attention (schedule / warning)
  - no drivers ready → availability:drivers-not-ready (dispatch / warning)
  - awaitingDispatch → dispatch:awaiting-driver (dispatch / warning)
  - unpaid_count → payment:unpaid-bookings (payment / warning)

**Design Decisions:**
  - getCrmTodaySnapshot called once (it internally calls getCrmAvailabilitySnapshot)
    to avoid running availability queries twice
  - Two sources run in parallel via Promise.allSettled (never throws)
  - Source failure emits system:warning issue rather than crashing or silently omitting
  - dedupeReadinessIssues keeps highest severity on ID collision
  - Severity mapping: SetupIssue "error" → "critical", "warning" → "warning", "info" → "info"
  - Scope derived from issue.id via SETUP_SCOPE_MAP lookup with "setup" fallback

**Deferred to Phase 9E:**
  - Service provider public/non-public distinction (requires staff_type filtering)
  - Resource conflict detection (per-booking compute in spaces-rules-utils)
  - Schedule coverage detail (per-staff, schedule-coverage-issues.tsx)
  - 14 missing checks from docs/CRM_READINESS_AUDIT.md Section E

**Notes:**
  - No existing CRM page behavior changed
  - No booking logic changed
  - No DB schema changed
  - Aggregator not wired to UI yet — Phase 9D will wire /crm/setup first

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-READINESS-PHASE9D-001)

**Task:** Phase 9D — Wire /crm/setup to Shared ReadinessIssueList

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/setup/page.tsx`
  - Added `getCrmReadiness` import (Phase 9C aggregator)
  - Added `ReadinessIssueList` import (Phase 9B shared component)
  - Removed `CrmSetupIssuesList` usage (import also removed from page; component file NOT deleted)
  - getCrmSetupHealth and getCrmReadiness now run in parallel via Promise.all
  - getCrmReadiness uses .catch(() => null) so readiness failure never crashes health cards
  - Summary banner: counts + status badge now derived from readiness.issues (full operational picture)
    with getCrmSetupHealth counts as safe fallback when readiness is null
  - Overall status badge (Critical / Warning / OK) added to summary banner
  - "Setup Issues" section renamed to "Readiness Issues" to reflect broader coverage
  - Issues section replaced: CrmSetupIssuesList → ReadinessIssueList
  - Safe fallback message shown when getCrmReadiness unexpectedly returns null
  - CrmSetupHealthCards unchanged — still powered by getCrmSetupHealth
  - All other sections (Booking Flow Rules, Setup Health, Setup Workspaces, Impact Matrix) unchanged

**Intentionally Left Unchanged:**
- `src/components/features/crm/setup/crm-setup-issues-list.tsx` — NOT deleted
- `src/lib/queries/crm-setup.ts` — NOT changed
- All other CRM pages — NOT migrated in this phase
- No booking logic changed

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-READINESS-PHASE9E-A-001)

**Task:** Phase 9E-A — Add Compact System Readiness Strip to /crm/today

**Files Added:**
- `src/components/features/crm/today/today-readiness-strip.tsx`
  - Server component. Props: `{ readiness: ReadinessResult | null }`
  - Header row: section label + status badge (Critical/Warning/All Clear) + count summary + "View all issues ›" → /crm/setup
  - Body: `ReadinessIssueList` with `compact={true}` and `maxItems={3}` (top 3 critical-first issues)
  - Safe fallback card when readiness is null
  - STATUS_STYLE record for color/bg/border per ReadinessStatus

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/today/page.tsx`
  - `getCrmReadiness(branchId).catch(() => null)` added to existing `Promise.all` — no extra round trip; graceful degradation to null if aggregator throws
  - `TodayReadinessStrip` rendered after `TodayWorkflowStrip`, before "Serve Customers" section
  - All existing Today sections unchanged (TodayAttentionStrip, TodayWorkflowStrip, TodayPriorityStrip, TodayStaffReadiness, TodayDispatchSnapshot, TodaySideRail, CrmBookingQueuePanel, TodaySystemMatchStatus, TodayEmergencyActions)

**Intentionally Left Unchanged:**
- TodayPriorityStrip, TodayAttentionStrip — not replaced

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (Phase 9E-B — CRM Services Provider Warnings → ReadinessIssueCard)

**Task:** CRM-READINESS-PHASE9E-B-001 — Migrate hand-rolled provider warning banners in the CRM Services panel to use shared `ReadinessIssueCard` and `ReadinessIssueList` components.

**Files Changed:**

- `src/components/features/crm/services/crm-service-therapist-panel.tsx`
  - Added `ReadinessIssueList` import and `ReadinessIssue` type import
  - Exported `createNoProviderReadinessIssue(row: ServiceRow): ReadinessIssue | null` — maps a no-provider ServiceRow to a ReadinessIssue (critical for public services, warning for internal)
  - Replaced hand-rolled aggregate banner (criticalCount/warningCount div) with `ReadinessIssueList compact` showing one issue per affected service

- `src/components/features/crm/services/provider-assignment-card.tsx`
  - Added `ReadinessIssueCard` import and `ReadinessIssue` type import
  - Added `buildNoProviderIssue(row: ServiceRow): ReadinessIssue | null` local helper (mirrors `createNoProviderReadinessIssue` but self-contained in the client component)
  - Computes `noProviderIssue = buildNoProviderIssue(row)` in component body
  - Replaced old ⛔/⚠️ italic text block with `<ReadinessIssueCard issue={noProviderIssue} compact />` in the else branch of the assigned-providers conditional

**Intentionally Left Unchanged:**
- Assign Provider dropdown (select + Assign button)
- Remove provider chips (ProviderChip + ✕ button)
- Inline StatusMessage (success/error feedback)
- `router.refresh()` on successful action
- `assignProviderToServiceAction` / `removeProviderFromServiceAction` calls
- Last-provider protection (lives in actions.ts)
- No booking logic changed. No DB schema changed. No other CRM pages touched.

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (Phase 9E-C — Schedule Setup Warnings → Shared Readiness Components)

**Task:** CRM-READINESS-PHASE9E-C-001 — Migrate hand-rolled schedule coverage warning banners in /crm/staff-availability to use shared ReadinessIssueCard and ReadinessIssueList components.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/schedule-readiness-utils.ts`
  - Pure helper functions (no React, no server-only APIs): `buildMissingScheduleIssue`, `buildNoGroupOrIndividualIssue`, `buildNoActiveScheduleIssue`, `buildNoOpeningShiftIssue`, `buildOnLeaveTodayIssue`
  - Usable in both server and client component contexts

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/schedule-coverage-issues.tsx`
  - Removed hand-rolled `IssueSection` sub-component (title/description/badge/color div header)
  - Replaced each section header with `ReadinessIssueCard compact` using helpers from utils
  - Kept per-staff `IssueCard` grid below each ReadinessIssueCard (preserves who-is-affected detail)
  - Empty state now uses `ReadinessIssueList` (issues=[], emptyTitle/emptyDescription) for shared styling
  - Issue order: critical (noGroupOrIndividual) → warning (noSchedule) → warning (noOpeningToday) → info (onLeaveToday)
  - Severity mappings: noGroupOrIndividual=critical, noSchedule/noOpeningToday=warning, onLeaveToday=info

- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/schedule-setup-health-summary.tsx`
  - Added imports: `ReadinessIssueCard`, `buildMissingScheduleIssue`
  - Replaced hand-rolled ⚠️ banner div with `<ReadinessIssueCard issue={buildMissingScheduleIssue(stats.missingSchedule)} />` (full/non-compact for context)
  - Stat cards grid unchanged

**Intentionally Left Unchanged:**
- All schedule data computation (noSchedule, noGroupOrIndividual, noOpeningToday, onLeaveToday filters)
- `IssueCard` per-staff detail cards (still show individual staff names with tag badges)
- `ScheduleSetupWorkspace` (4-tab editor), `ScheduleSetupExplainer`, `ScheduleRelatedTools`
- `ManualScheduleImport` wizard and `applyManualScheduleImportAction`
- `schedule-setup-workspace.tsx` — untouched
- No booking logic changed. No DB schema changed. No schedule save actions changed.

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (Phase 9E-E — Spaces & Rules Resource Conflicts → Shared Readiness Components)

**Task:** CRM-READINESS-PHASE9E-E-001 — Migrate hand-rolled resource conflict warnings in /crm/spaces-rules to use shared ReadinessIssueCard and ReadinessIssueList components.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/spaces-rules/spaces-readiness-utils.ts`
  - `mapResourceConflictToReadinessIssue(conflict, index)` — one ReadinessIssue per conflict; conflict.description → problem field (detail preserved); severity from conflict type: missing_assignment=warning, overlap/capacity_overflow=critical
  - `buildConflictSummaryIssues(conflicts)` — aggregates to one summary issue per conflict type; used in OverviewTab alerts section

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/spaces-rules/conflicts-tab.tsx`
  - Removed hand-rolled `ConflictRow` sub-component and lucide-react icon imports (AlertTriangle, CircleDashed, Wrench)
  - Maps all conflicts via `mapResourceConflictToReadinessIssue` then passes to `ReadinessIssueList` (non-compact: problem/impact/fix/action all visible)
  - Empty state uses ReadinessIssueList's built-in emptyTitle/emptyDescription

- `src/components/features/spaces-rules/overview-tab.tsx`
  - Removed custom amber/red alert div blocks + lucide imports (AlertTriangle, CircleDashed)
  - Replaced "Alerts" card content with `ReadinessIssueList compact` fed by `buildConflictSummaryIssues(conflicts)` — shows one card per conflict type with count badge

**Intentionally Left Unchanged:**
- `computeResourceConflicts()` in spaces-rules-utils.ts — all conflict detection logic preserved
- `computeKpiData()`, `ResourceConflict` type, `ResourceRow` — unchanged
- `SpacesRulesHealthSummary` — pure stat cards, no warning banners, untouched

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (Phase 9E-G — CRM Availability Warnings → Shared Readiness Components)

**Task:** CRM-READINESS-PHASE9E-G-001 — Migrate needs-attention / live availability warning UI in /crm/availability to shared ReadinessIssueCard and ReadinessIssueList components.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/crm/availability/availability-readiness-utils.ts`
  - `buildAvailabilityReadinessIssues(summary)` — maps CrmAvailabilitySummary → ReadinessIssue[]: notCheckedIn → warning (scope:daily), needsAttention → warning (scope:schedule), driversTotal>0 && driversReady===0 → warning (scope:dispatch)
  - `buildNoScheduleStaffIssue(count)` — single issue for ScheduleIssuesView tab banner

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/availability/page.tsx`
  - Added imports: ReadinessIssueList, buildAvailabilityReadinessIssues
  - Added `<ReadinessIssueList compact>` between CrmAvailabilitySummary and CrmAvailabilityClient; emits issues only when snapshot.summary has notCheckedIn/needsAttention/no-driver-ready; shows "Live availability looks ready" empty state when none

- `src/components/features/crm/availability/crm-availability-client.tsx` (minimal change)
  - Added imports: ReadinessIssueCard, ReadinessIssueList, buildNoScheduleStaffIssue
  - `ScheduleIssuesView` only: replaced description paragraph with `ReadinessIssueCard compact`; replaced custom empty state div with `ReadinessIssueList issues={[]}` empty state; per-staff orange-bordered grid preserved

**Intentionally Left Unchanged:**
- `CrmAvailabilitySummary` stat cards (Scheduled, Checked In, Available, Busy, Not Checked In, Drivers Ready, Needs Attention) — pure metrics, no banner
- `StaffListView` (check-in/check-out buttons untouched)

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-READINESS-PHASE9E-F-001)

**Task:** Phase 9E-F — Migrate /crm/dispatch Home-Service Dispatch Warnings to Shared Readiness Components

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/dispatch/dispatch-readiness-utils.ts`
  - `mapDispatchAlertToReadinessIssue(alert)` — maps single DispatchAlert → ReadinessIssue; severity: "danger"→"critical", "warning"→"warning"; scope:"dispatch"; contextual impact+fix per alert title pattern (No Driver Assigned / Location Needs Confirmation / Booking Running Late)
  - `buildAlertIssues(alerts)` — DispatchAlert[] → ReadinessIssue[], preserves order

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/dispatch/dispatch-workspace.tsx` (minimal)
  - Removed `AlertBanner` sub-component (lucide AlertTriangle, amber/red styled divs, return-null-when-empty pattern)
  - Removed `AlertTriangle` from lucide imports
  - Added imports: `ReadinessIssueList`, `buildAlertIssues`
  - Replaced `<AlertBanner alerts={data.alerts} />` with `<ReadinessIssueList issues={buildAlertIssues(data.alerts)} compact emptyTitle="No active dispatch alerts" ...>`

**Intentionally Left Unchanged:**
- `src/lib/bookings/ops-warnings.ts` — OperationalWarning computation untouched
- `src/lib/queries/dispatch-queries.ts` — computeAlerts, getDispatchData untouched
- `src/features/dispatch/types.ts` — DispatchAlert, DispatchStatus untouched
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/dispatch/page.tsx` — untouched

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-READINESS-PHASE9F-001)

**Task:** Phase 9F — Add Global CRM Readiness Badge / Indicator

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/crm/readiness/crm-readiness-badge.tsx`
  - Server component — compact single-line pill linking to /crm/setup
  - Props: `{ readiness: ReadinessResult | null }`
  - Visual states: critical (red), warning (amber), ok (green), null/failure (muted)
  - Counts: criticalCount + warningCount from readiness.issues; summary "X critical · Y warnings" or "All clear"
  - Failure state: "Review needed" with neutral muted style
  - Uses `Link` from next/link; `aria-label` for accessibility

- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/layout.tsx` (NEW)
  - Server layout wrapping all /crm/* routes
  - Calls `getLayoutStaffContext()` (React cache()-wrapped — no extra DB call vs dashboard layout)
  - Calls `getCrmReadiness(branchId).catch(() => null)` — failure-safe
  - Renders CrmReadinessBadge above {children}
  - Mobile: badge wrapper uses `px-4 pt-3 md:px-0 md:pt-0` (main is p-0 mobile / p-5 desktop)

**Intentionally Left Unchanged:**
- `src/components/features/crm/today/today-readiness-strip.tsx` — /crm/today page-level strip preserved
- `src/components/shared/readiness-issue-list.tsx` — no changes
- All booking logic, dispatch logic, availability engine, schedule engine unchanged
- No DB schema changed. No public /book behavior changed.

**How branchId is resolved:**
`getLayoutStaffContext()` is already React-`cache()`-wrapped. The `(dashboard)/layout.tsx` calls it
first; `crm/layout.tsx` calls it again — React deduplicates to zero extra DB calls per request.
`branchId = ctx?.me?.branch_id ?? null`.

**Commit:** 7ecc036

- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 0 warnings)

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-READINESS-PHASE9G-1-001)

**Task:** Phase 9G-1 — Add Daily Operations Missing Readiness Checks

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/queries/crm-readiness.ts`
  - Added `import { createClient } from "@/lib/supabase/server"`
  - Added `getCheckedInNotScheduledIssue(branchId, today, dayOfWeek)`:
    - Queries `staff_shift_checkins` (status='checked_in') then cross-references `staff_schedules` (day_of_week, is_active)
    - Emits `daily:checked-in-not-scheduled` warning when ghost check-ins exist
  - Added `getNoOpeningShiftIssue(branchId, dayOfWeek)`:
    - Queries `staff` (branch_id) then `staff_schedules` (day_of_week, is_active)
    - Suppressed if no staff are scheduled at all (branch likely closed)
    - Emits `daily:no-opening-shift-today` warning when staff are scheduled but none have shift_type='opening'
  - Added `getPendingBookingFollowUpIssue(branchId, today)`:
    - Queries `bookings` where type='online', status='pending', created_at <= now-30min, booking_date >= today
    - Emits `daily:booking-request-no-follow-up` warning for stale pending online bookings
  - Added `getDailyOperationsReadinessIssues(branchId, today, dayOfWeek)`:
    - Coordinator that runs all three checks via `Promise.allSettled` (never rejects)
    - Individual check failures silently suppressed; other checks still surface
  - Modified `getCrmReadinessIssues`:
    - Added `dayOfWeek` computation from `today`
    - Extended `Promise.allSettled` from 2 to 3 sources (now includes `getDailyOperationsReadinessIssues`)
    - Handles `dailyOpsResult` fulfilled/rejected paths with source-failure fallback

**Deferred Checks:**
- None in Phase 9G-1. All three required checks implemented.
- Note: `getNoOpeningShiftIssue` checks individual `staff_schedules` only (not `staff_group_schedule_rules`).
  If a branch uses only group rules to define opening shifts, this check may produce false positives.
  Phase 9G future work can extend this to also check group rules if needed.

**Intentionally Unchanged:**
- No UI changes — existing badge (/crm/layout.tsx), /crm/today strip, /crm/setup list naturally surface new issues
- `src/lib/actions/staff-checkins.ts` — unchanged
- `src/lib/queries/crm-availability.ts` — unchanged
- `src/lib/queries/crm-today.ts` — unchanged
- All booking logic, dispatch logic, availability engine, schedule engine unchanged
- No DB schema changed. No public /book behavior changed.

**Query Strategy:**
- Check 1: 2 Supabase queries (staff_shift_checkins → staff_schedules cross-ref)
- Check 2: 2 Supabase queries (staff → staff_schedules)
- Check 3: 1 Supabase query (bookings with 4 filters + limit 20)
- All queries branch-scoped, date-scoped, column-minimal (select only needed fields)

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-READINESS-PHASE9G-2-001)

**Task:** Phase 9G-2 — Add Dispatch Missing Readiness Checks

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/queries/crm-readiness.ts` — added Phase 9G-2 section with 3 checks + coordinator; integrated as Source 4 in getCrmReadinessIssues

**Checks Added:**
1. `dispatch:assigned-driver-not-checked-in` (critical) — driver assigned to active HS booking but not checked in today. Two-query: bookings with driver_id → staff_shift_checkins cross-ref.
2. `dispatch:home-service-missing-address` (critical) — active HS booking missing metadata.home_service_address.full_address. Single bookings query + TypeScript filter on JSONB.
3. `dispatch:home-service-missing-destination-coordinates` (warning) — active HS booking missing lat/lng coordinates. Same query pattern as Check 2; checks numeric validity via typeof + Number.isNaN.

**Checks Skipped:**
- Check 4 (active home-service no driver) — deliberately excluded. Covered by existing `dispatch:awaiting-driver` issue from mapDispatchStatsToReadinessIssues / getCrmTodaySnapshot. Emitting a second ID for the same condition would confuse operators.

**Helper added:**
- `extractHomeServiceAddress(metadata)` — safe JSONB accessor for home_service_address sub-object
- `getDispatchMissingReadinessIssues(branchId, today)` — Promise.allSettled coordinator; always resolves

**Integration:**
- getCrmReadinessIssues now runs 4 sources in parallel (was 3)
- Source 4 failure emits system:failure:dispatch-missing warning (same pattern as other sources)

**Notes:**
- Home-service detection: `.or("type.eq.home_service,delivery_type.eq.home_service")` (both legacy + new field)
- Active status filter: `.neq("status", "cancelled").neq("status", "completed").neq("status", "no_show")`
- Coordinates stored in metadata JSONB at home_service_address.lat / .lng (numeric)
- Address stored at metadata.home_service_address.full_address (string)
- All queries: branch-scoped, date-scoped (today), column-minimal, limit 50 for booking fetches; entity IDs capped at 20
- No UI changes required — global badge, /crm/today strip, /crm/setup list, /crm/dispatch readiness surface these automatically
- No dispatch actions changed. No booking logic changed. No database schema changed. No public /book behavior changed.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing (85 routes)

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (DISPATCH-CENTER-3TAB-001)

**Task:** Build Home-Service Dispatch Center with 3 Tabs

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/dispatch/dispatch-workspace.tsx` — replaced with 3-tab shell; same `HomeServiceDispatchWorkspace` / `HomeServiceDispatchWorkspaceProps` export interface preserved
- `src/components/features/dispatch/dispatch-summary-cards.tsx` (new) — 6 KPI cards: Needs Driver, Ready, En Route, In Service, Completed, Alerts; all values derived from DispatchData
- `src/components/features/dispatch/dispatch-flow-tab.tsx` (new) — Tab 1: booking queue (status badges, missing-info badges, address/staff snippets) + selected booking readiness checklist (therapist/driver/address/GPS/payment) + AssignmentRecommendationPanel for awaiting-driver items
- `src/components/features/dispatch/dispatch-live-map-tab.tsx` (new) — Tab 2: active trips list + honest map placeholder (no fake map; collects live location data counts) + selected trip detail
- `src/components/features/dispatch/dispatch-travel-progress-tab.tsx` (new) — Tab 3: desktop table / mobile cards with progress dot stages (Confirmed → Driver → En Route → Arrived → In Service → Done)
- `src/components/features/dispatch/dispatch-emergency-actions.tsx` (new) — 6 emergency link shortcuts
- `src/components/features/dispatch/dispatch-related-tools.tsx` (new) — 6 related tool links

**Existing components preserved/reused:**
- `dispatch-readiness-utils.ts` — unchanged; `buildAlertIssues` still used in workspace
- `AssignmentRecommendationPanel` — unchanged; reused in Tab 1 for driver assignment
- `assignBookingDriverAction` / `getDriverRecommendationsAction` — unchanged server actions reused
- Both `/crm/dispatch` and `/manager/dispatch` page files — unchanged; same component interface

**Visual improvements:**
- Page title: "Home-Service Dispatch Center" (was "Home Service Dispatch")
- Architecture note visible to operators
- Booking queue: status badges + missing-info + payment badges
- Dispatch readiness checklist per selected booking (therapist, driver, address, GPS, payment)
- Trip timeline visible when travel has started
- Progress stage visualization in Tab 3
- Emergency actions card + related tools card at bottom

**Data: live vs empty state:**
- Summary cards: live (derived from DispatchData.items)
- Dispatch alerts: live (buildAlertIssues from DispatchData.alerts)
- Booking queue: live bookings from getDispatchData
- Selected panel: live RealDispatchItem fields
- Active trips (Tab 2): live dispatchStatus filter
- Location data: live (currentLocation / lat / lng from RealDispatchItem)
- Map rendering: honest placeholder ("Live map will appear when integration is connected")
- Progress stages: derived from live dispatchStatus + timestamps

**Notes:**
- No "Confirm Dispatch" server action was created — Tab 1 shows an honest informational note for ready bookings ("handled by driver via Driver Portal")
- No fake map, no fake route lines, no fake location markers
- Map placeholder shows how many trips have live location snapshots and how many are missing coordinates
- No UI changes to /crm/today dispatch snapshot, /crm/setup readiness list, or /crm/availability
- No booking logic changed. No dispatch actions changed. No DB schema changed. No public /book changed.

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (HYDRATION-FIX-001 — Fix nested <a> in BookingCard)

**Task:** Fix hydration error: `In HTML, <a> cannot be a descendant of <a>` in `crm-booking-queue-panel.tsx`.

**Root Cause:** `BookingCard` wraps its content in `<Link href={...}>` (which renders as `<a>`). Inside the home-service footer row, the "Map ↗" link was also rendered as `<a href={booking.hs_map_url} target="_blank">` — invalid nested anchors per HTML spec.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/crm/today/crm-booking-queue-panel.tsx` — replaced the inner `<a>` map link with `<button type="button">` that calls `window.open(booking.hs_map_url!, "_blank", "noopener,noreferrer")` on click, preserving the same visual style and UX.

**Commit:** `25ac12f`

**Notes:**
- No logic change — "Map ↗" still opens the Google Maps URL in a new tab
- `e.preventDefault()` + `e.stopPropagation()` prevent the outer Link click from firing
- No other components affected

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-SERVICES-ASSIGNMENTS-001 — Therapist Assignments Tab)

**Task:** Add Therapist Assignments tab to /crm/services.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/services/page.tsx` — replaced stacked Section layout with `CrmServicesWorkspace`; reads `?tab=assignments` searchParam to pre-select tab server-side
- `src/components/features/crm/services/crm-services-workspace.tsx` (NEW) — client tab shell managing "Active Services" | "Therapist Assignments" tab state; initialised from `initialTab` prop (no useEffect needed)
- `src/components/features/crm/services/crm-therapist-assignment-tab.tsx` (NEW) — full Therapist Assignments tab: intro card, stat cards (active services + services without therapist), filter row (search / category / service type / missing-only toggle), desktop assignment table, right-side help panel
- `src/components/features/crm/services/service-assignment-table-row.tsx` (NEW) — individual table row with expand/collapse; inline assign (select + button) + remove (chip ✕) controls, reuses existing server actions
- `src/components/features/crm/services/types.ts` — added `ServiceTableRow` (extends `ServiceRow` with `duration` and `price`)
- `src/components/features/crm/services/crm-service-therapist-panel.tsx` — updated readiness `actionHref` to `/crm/services?tab=assignments`
- `src/components/features/crm/services/provider-assignment-card.tsx` — updated readiness `actionHref` to `/crm/services?tab=assignments`

**Notes:**
- Active Services tab keeps existing ServicesOfferedTab (service toggle, visibility, price overrides) completely unchanged
- All assignment mutations use existing `assignProviderToServiceAction` and `removeProviderFromServiceAction` — no new server actions
- Last-provider protection for public active services remains enforced server-side
- Drivers, utility staff, CRM/front-desk, inactive staff excluded by `isValidProvider()` logic (same as before)
- `buildServiceTableRows()` is a client-side pure function (mirrors server-side `buildServiceRows` in panel)
- Tab switching from readiness links uses `?tab=assignments` query param (server-side, no useEffect lint issue)
- `id="therapist-assignments"` is on the tab content container for direct scroll anchoring when the tab is active
- No booking logic changed. No dispatch actions changed. No DB schema changed. No public /book changed.

- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ PASS
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ PASS
- `pnpm build`: ✅ PASS (85 routes)

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-SERVICES-COMPACT-001 — Compact Provider Table Rows)

**Task:** Fix scalability of Therapist Assignments table — rows with many providers expanded vertically.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/crm/services/service-assignment-table-row.tsx` (rewritten) — now shows max 3 mini provider chips inline + "+N more" badge + "N assigned" count; Manage/Assign Therapist button opens Sheet (no inline expand)
- `src/components/features/crm/services/provider-assignment-sheet.tsx` (NEW) — right-side Sheet (480px) with service summary bar, full vertical provider list with Remove buttons, Add Provider select + Assign button, status feedback, eligibility note

**Notes:**
- Sheet uses existing `Sheet`/`SheetContent`/`SheetHeader`/`SheetTitle` from `@/components/ui/sheet` (backed by `@base-ui/react/dialog`)
- All mutations reuse `assignProviderToServiceAction` and `removeProviderFromServiceAction` unchanged
- Last-provider protection for public active services still enforced server-side
- Sheet resets `status` and `selectedStaffId` on close
- `router.refresh()` after mutations keeps data fresh without full page reload

**Build Status:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ PASS
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ PASS
- `pnpm build`: ✅ PASS (85 routes)

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-SERVICES-TABLE-REDESIGN-001 — Professional SaaS Table Redesign)

**Task:** Redesign Therapist Assignments tab into a compact professional SaaS table.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/crm/services/crm-therapist-assignment-tab.tsx` (rewritten)
  - 4 KPI `StatCard` components: Active Services, Without Therapist, Eligible Providers, Fully Assigned
  - `RightRail` with "Who can be assigned?" card, "Assignment Overview" card (color-coded dots + counts), and Tip card
  - CSS grid layout: `grid-cols-[minmax(0,1fr)_280px]` (fluid main table + 280px right rail)
  - Table header updated to 5 columns: Service | Category | Assigned Therapists | Status | Actions
  - Client-side pagination: 10/25/50 rows per page; ellipsis page numbers via `getPageNumbers()`
  - `safeCurrentPage = Math.min(currentPage, totalPages)` — clamps page on filter change without useEffect
  - Filter row event handlers explicitly call `setCurrentPage(1)` (in event handlers, not effects)
- `src/components/features/crm/services/service-assignment-table-row.tsx` (updated)
  - Added `getAssignmentStatus(row)` helper: Well Assigned (≥2 providers, green), Low Coverage (1 provider, amber), Needs Assignment (0 providers, red)
  - Added STATUS `<td>` between Assigned Therapists and Actions columns
  - STATUS cell renders pill badge (color-coded) + caption text below

**Commit:** 481aac8

**Notes:**
- Table now has 5 columns matching header: Service | Category | Assigned Therapists | Status | Actions
- All mutations, last-provider protection, and Sheet drawer behavior unchanged
- No booking logic changed. No DB schema changed.

**Build Status:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ PASS
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ PASS
- `pnpm build`: ✅ PASS (85 routes)

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (WORKSPACE-PREFETCH-001)

**Task:** Implement workspace route warm-up and smart prefetching for CradleHub CRM/Manager/Owner workspaces.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/workspace/workspace-route-prefetcher.tsx` — reusable client component with connection-aware prefetching (Data Saver, 2g guards, requestIdleCallback fallback)
- `src/components/features/workspace/workspace-prefetch-config.ts` — workspace route configs with immediate / idle / hover priority tiers
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/layout.tsx` — manager layout wrapper mounting the prefetcher
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/layout.tsx` — owner layout wrapper mounting the prefetcher
- `src/lib/queries/workspace-cached.ts` — `unstable_cache` wrappers for high-traffic queries (today snapshot, availability, dispatch, setup health)

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/layout.tsx` — added `<WorkspaceRoutePrefetcher config={CRM_PREFETCH} />`
- `src/components/features/dashboard/sidebar.tsx` — NavLink now calls `router.prefetch` on `onMouseEnter` for instant hover warming
- `src/lib/cache/cache-tags.ts` — added workspace-scoped cache tags (`crm-workspace`, `crm-bookings`, `crm-dispatch`, `crm-availability`, `crm-setup`, `manager-workspace`, `owner-workspace`) plus batch invalidation helpers (`invalidateCrmWorkspace`, `invalidateManagerWorkspace`, `invalidateOwnerWorkspace`)
- `src/lib/actions/staff-checkins.ts` — added `invalidateCrmWorkspace` + `invalidateManagerWorkspace` after check-in/check-out
- `src/lib/actions/driver-actions.ts` — added `invalidateCrmWorkspace` after driver assignment
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/bookings/actions.ts` — added `invalidateTag(cacheTags.crmWorkspace(...))` after payment confirmation
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/bookings/actions.ts` — added workspace tag invalidation after status edit, booking edit, and payment update
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/bookings/actions.ts` — added owner + CRM workspace tag invalidation after status/payment updates (fetches booking branch_id for cross-branch owner actions)
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/actions.ts` — added CRM workspace tag invalidation after customer create/update
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/staff/actions.ts` — added workspace tag invalidation after schedule/blocked-time/override mutations
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/staff-availability/actions.ts` — added CRM workspace tag invalidation after manual schedule import
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/services/actions.ts` — added CRM workspace tag invalidation after provider assign/remove

**Design Decisions:**
- Immediate routes (today, control, bookings, dispatch) prefetch ~250ms after mount.
- Idle routes (availability, staff-availability, customers, setup) defer via `requestIdleCallback` or 2s fallback.
- Heavy routes (reports, live map, reconciliation, analytics) are NEVER auto-prefetched — they warm only on sidebar hover.
- Slow connections (<0.5 downlink, 2g, Data Saver) skip idle prefetch entirely.
- Cached queries use 1-hour `revalidate` with tag-based invalidation on mutations, keeping data fresh without extra DB round-trips.

### 2026-05-26 — v0 (CRM-SPACES-REDESIGN-001 — CRM Spaces & Availability Redesign)

**Task:** Redesign CRM Spaces & Rules page UI only. Transform it from a generic admin settings page into a clean "Spaces & Availability" operations center for front-desk CRM staff.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/spaces-rules/page.tsx` — Simplified: removed heavy explainer/health/access components, renders only workspace component
- `src/components/features/spaces-rules/spaces-rules-workspace.tsx` — Added CRM-specific layout with conditional rendering based on workspaceContext
- `src/components/features/spaces-rules/spaces-rules-utils.ts` — Added CrmOperationalKpiData type, computeCrmOperationalKpi(), resource status helpers
- `src/components/features/spaces-rules/spaces-rules-kpi-cards.tsx` — Added CrmOperationalKpiStrip (6 operational KPIs: Total, Available, Occupied, Conflicts, Missing, Blocked)
- `src/components/features/spaces-rules/spaces-rules-tabs.tsx` — Added CrmSpacesTabs (Overview, Spaces, Conflicts) with conflict count badge
- `src/components/features/spaces-rules/overview-tab.tsx` — Added CrmOverviewTab with readiness summary, resource type breakdown, alerts

- Warm gold (#B08850) for occupied states
- Soft orange (#D97706) for warnings only
- Red (#DC2626) only for critical conflicts
- Compact 6-KPI operational strip
- Simplified tabs (Overview, Spaces, Conflicts)
- Resource list with status badges and live booking counts
- Conflict grouping by severity with actionable recommendations

**Preserved:**
- Owner/Manager layout completely unchanged (uses workspaceContext conditional)
- All permission flags (canManageResources, canEditRules) behavior intact
- No changes to booking logic, RBAC, Supabase queries, or DB schema

**Build Status:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ PASS
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ PASS (0 errors, 1 pre-existing warning)
- `pnpm build`: ⚠️ Pre-existing environment issue (supabaseUrl required at build time) — not related to this task

### 2026-05-26 — Claude Code (FRONTDESK-UI-REDESIGN-001 — Front Desk Pages UI Redesign)

**Task:** Redesign and simplify the overloaded Front Desk operational pages so main content appears above the fold, readiness warnings are accessible but not dominant, and each page reads like a focused professional tool.

**Pages Fixed:**
1. `/crm/today` — Daily Operations Center
2. `/crm/setup` — Rules & Setup Center
3. `/crm/availability` — Live Availability & Check-In Center

**DO NOT TOUCH — Preserved Unchanged:**
- `/crm/staff-availability` — Schedule Setup Center (no changes)

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/shared/system-readiness-bar.tsx` — Compact single-line horizontal bar showing total issue count, category breakdown (Critical: N · Warning: N), and a "Review issues →" button that opens a Sheet panel. Panel groups all issues by scope (Daily Ops, Schedule, Dispatch, Payment, Services, Spaces, Setup, System). Fully keyboard-accessible; closes on ESC. Client component — receives plain serializable `ReadinessIssue[]` props from server components.
- `src/components/shared/page-help-disclosure.tsx` — Collapsible "How this page works" section. Defaults closed so it doesn't push main content down. Uses `aria-expanded` / `aria-controls` / `role="region"` for accessibility. Trigger shows ℹ️ icon + label + animated chevron.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/today/page.tsx`
  - Removed `TodayReadinessStrip` (showed up to 3 full ReadinessIssueCards inline)
  - Added `SystemReadinessBar` above the page header — single compact line
  - Moved `TodayQuickActions` immediately after `PageHeader` (primary actions above the fold)
  - Removed `TodayWorkflowStrip` (static step guide rarely needed after first day)
  - Removed `TodayAttentionStrip` (notification strip replaced by readiness bar)
  - Removed `TodaySystemMatchStatus` (orientation card; info now accessible via the review panel)
  - Kept all data queries, server actions, booking queue, KPI strip, right rail, emergency actions unchanged

- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/setup/page.tsx`
  - Removed verbose warning banner (the large colored alert block)
  - Removed inline `ReadinessIssueList` (full list of issues was shown openly)
  - Added `SystemReadinessBar` above the page header
  - Kept `CrmBookingFlowRules`, `CrmSetupHealthCards`, `CrmSetupWorkspaceTiles`, `CrmBookingImpactMatrix`
  - Readiness fallback: when `getCrmReadiness` fails, bar shows empty (All Clear) — health cards below still render

- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/availability/page.tsx`
  - Moved `CheckInExplainer` (3-card explainer section) inside `PageHelpDisclosure` — collapsed by default
  - Removed inline `ReadinessIssueList` between summary and board
  - Added `SystemReadinessBar` above page header — derives issues from `buildAvailabilityReadinessIssues`
  - Moved `CrmAvailabilityClient` (the 4-tab board) up — immediately after KPI summary
  - Moved `StartDayChecklist` into a second `PageHelpDisclosure` — collapsed by default
  - Kept `LiveAvailabilityImpactCard` and `AvailabilityRelatedTools` as informational footer

**Design Decisions:**
- `SystemReadinessBar` is a single slim bar (36px tall) — never pushes content down.
- Full issue details are always accessible via "Review issues →" Sheet panel.
- `PageHelpDisclosure` uses native `hidden` attribute (no animation flicker, SSR-safe).
- All existing data queries, server actions, permissions, booking logic, and Schedule Setup page are unchanged.
- No new npm packages installed.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 1 pre-existing warning in staff-availability/actions.ts)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing (85/85 routes)

### 2026-05-26 — Kimi (CRM-SCHEDULE-REDESIGN-001 — Fixed-Height Daily Timeline Board)

**Task:** Redesign CRM Schedule page into a fixed-height daily timeline board with density controls, collapsible staff groups, and inline details panel.

**Problem:** The schedule grid expanded vertically with every staff member. With 30+ staff, the page became an extremely long scroll page.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-density.tsx` — Density context + toggle UI
- `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-staff-group.tsx` — Collapsible staff group headers
- `src/components/features/schedule/crm-schedule-details-panel.tsx` — Inline right-side details panel

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/schedule/page.tsx` — Added PageHeader, SystemReadinessBar, wrapper
- `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-workspace.tsx` — CRM uses inline panel + density provider
- `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-board-panel.tsx` — Added `showHeader` prop
- `src/components/features/schedule/daily-schedule-board.tsx` — Fixed-height scroll container + staff groups
- `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-time-header.tsx` — Density-aware height
- `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-staff-cell.tsx` — Density-aware sizing
- `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-staff-row.tsx` — Density-aware row height
- `src/lib/utils/schedule-timeline.ts` — Added `getRowHeightPx()` and `getHeaderHeightPx()`

**Behavior:**
- Fixed-height board (`maxHeight: calc(100vh - 380px)`) with internal scroll
- Sticky staff column + time header preserved
- Density: Comfortable (76px), Compact (56px, default), Ultra-compact (42px)
- Groups: In Progress (expanded), Scheduled Today (expanded), Off Today (collapsed)
- Owner/manager schedule pages completely untouched

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing (85/85 routes)

### 2026-05-26 — Claude (FRONTDESK-UI-REDESIGN-001 Phase 2 — Availability Board Deep Redesign)

**Task:** The Live Availability board was still too sparse and wide after Phase 1 — still Kanban-style with tall cards. Deep redesign into a 4-column dense operations board/table hybrid matching the approved mockup direction.

**Files Rewritten (3):**

`src/components/features/crm/availability/crm-availability-board.tsx`:
- Complete rewrite from 5-column Kanban (tall cards, static layout) → 4-column fixed-height compact board
- `BOARD_HEIGHT = 380px`; each column has `overflow-y: auto` for scroll within the fixed height
- Columns: Not Checked In (amber, `#c97a18`) | Available Now (green, `#2d9e63`) | Busy/Assigned (blue, `#2471a3`) | Needs Attention (orange, `#c97a18`)
- `CompactStaffRow`: `minHeight: 72px`, flex row — 32px Avatar with initials + colored bg + name/role/time/booking-service div + StatusChip + CheckinAction
- `Avatar`: 32px circle, name initials, bg color driven by `AVATAR_BG: Record<LiveStatus, string>`
- `STATUS_META: Record<LiveStatus, {...}>` for status badge colors
- `NeedsAttentionContent`: groups staff into "No Schedule Set" and "Needs Review" via `buildGroups()`; shows group header with count badge + up to 4 rows + "+N more" overflow
- Off Today / Checked Out removed as separate columns — accessible via Staff List tab
- `maxPerColumn` prop kept for backward compat (unused)

`src/components/features/crm/availability/crm-availability-summary.tsx`:
- Complete rewrite — replaced tall `StatCard` (1.75rem value font-size) with compact `MetricChip` inline components
- `MetricChip`: `inline-flex`, `padding: 5px 11px`, `border-radius: 8px`, 7px colored dot + 10px uppercase label + 14px bold value
- `highlight` prop: colored border + faint bg when actionable (checkedIn > 0, availableNow > 0, notCheckedIn > 0, etc.)
- Chips: Scheduled N/N | Checked In | Available | Busy | Not In | Drivers N/N | Attention (conditional, only when > 0)
- Layout: `flexWrap: "wrap"`, `gap: "0.5rem"` — chips flow naturally, no grid

`src/components/features/crm/availability/crm-availability-client.tsx`:
- Added quick action buttons right of the tab bar: ⚠ Schedule Issues (amber, shows when issueCount > 0 and not already on that tab), 🚗 Drivers (shows when driverCount > 0 and not on driver tab), Staff List (shows when not on staff_list tab), ↺ Refresh (always, useTransition + router.refresh())
- Quick action button style: 11px/500, surface bg, soft border, radius 6
- Tab bar tightened: font-size 12, font-weight 600 when active; Schedule Issues badge uses `#c97a18`
- All four tab panels (live_board, staff_list, schedule_issues, driver_readiness) preserved exactly in behavior
- StaffListView, ScheduleIssuesView, DriverReadinessView: no functional changes

**What was NOT changed:** getCrmAvailabilitySnapshot query, check-in/check-out server actions, RBAC, schedule logic, dispatch logic, all other pages, availability calculations.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 1 pre-existing warning in staff-availability/actions.ts)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing (85/85 routes)

### 2026-05-26 — Kimi (CRM-SIDEBAR-NAV-FIX-001 — Fix CRM Sidebar Navigation)

**Task:** Fix CRM sidebar navigation grouping and workspace badge sublabel bug.

**Problem 1:** Workspace badge showed user's role access level instead of workspace description.
- Example: Owner viewing `/crm/today` saw "FRONT DESK WORKSPACE · Owner access" instead of "Front-desk access".
- This was misleading for users and made it unclear which workspace they were actually in.

**Problem 2:** CRM nav groups were not optimally organized.
- "Availability" and "Schedule Setup" were in separate groups, making daily readiness tools hard to find.
- "Schedule Setup" was under "Staff & Internal Work" instead of near other daily operations tools.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/dashboard/sidebar.tsx`
  - Removed `roleMeta.sublabel` override in workspace badge `meta` object
  - Badge now uses `pathMeta` directly so sublabel describes the current workspace
  - All roles viewing any workspace now see the correct workspace description

- `src/components/features/dashboard/nav-config.ts`
  - Reorganized CRM_NAV_GROUPS from 5 groups → 6 groups
  - New "Daily Readiness" group: Staff Availability (`/crm/availability`), Schedule Setup (`/crm/staff-availability`)
  - "Main Operations" reordered: Today, Control Center, Bookings, Dispatch, Live Map, Schedule
  - "Control" renamed to "Control Center"
  - "Availability" renamed to "Staff Availability"
  - CSR_HEAD_NAV_GROUPS and CSR_STAFF_NAV_GROUPS now use defensive spread `[...CRM_NAV_GROUPS]`

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing (85/85 routes)
- Note: 3 pre-existing lint errors in committed code (unrelated to this change)

### 2026-05-26 — Kimi (CRM-SERVICES-MODAL-PILOT-001 — Centered Provider Assignment Modal)

**Task:** Pilot the centered task modal pattern on the CRM Services provider assignment UI.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/crm/services/provider-assignment-sheet.tsx` (rewritten)
  - Converted from side Sheet to centered Dialog (`sm:max-w-3xl`, `max-h-[85vh]`)
  - Added fixed footer with "Done" button and assigned provider count summary
  - Added `min-h-0` to scrollable body for proper flex overflow handling
  - Replaced native `<select>` dropdown with searchable provider list:
    - Search input filters eligible providers by name
    - Each provider shown as a compact row (avatar, name, staff type badge, "Add" button)
    - Immediate assign on click (calls existing `assignProviderToServiceAction`)
    - Empty state for no search matches
  - Assigned providers section unchanged (avatar, name, type badge, "Remove" button)
  - Service summary bar preserved (name, category, duration, price, delivery type, visibility)
  - Status messages and eligibility note preserved
  - All server actions unchanged (`assignProviderToServiceAction`, `removeProviderFromServiceAction`)

**Design Decisions:**
- Footer stays visible while body scrolls — `shrink-0` header/summary/footer + `flex-1 min-h-0 overflow-y-auto` body
- One-provider-at-a-time assignment preserved (no batch action needed)
- Search state resets on modal close
- Mobile: full-screen `max-sm:h-[100dvh]` with same scrollable body + sticky footer

**Scope:**
- CRM Services page only — Manager and Owner services pages untouched
- No booking logic changed. No DB schema changed. No RBAC changed.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 1 pre-existing warning in staff-availability/actions.ts)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing (85/85 routes)

### 2026-05-28 — Claude (SERVICE-MGMT-BUGFIX-001 — Service management bug fixes)

**Task:** Fix three service-management bugs identified via static code inspection of src.zip.

**Files Changed:**

`src/components/features/staff/staff-service-editor-sheet.tsx` (updated):
- `DialogContent` height: `max-h-[85vh]` → `h-[90dvh] max-h-[90dvh]`; added `max-sm:max-h-[100dvh]`
- Scrollable body: added `min-h-0` and `overscroll-contain`; added `pb-24` bottom padding
- Fixes: service list items below the viewport were unreachable on desktop

`src/app/(dashboard)/crm/services/actions.ts` (updated):
- `CRM_SETUP_ROLES`: added `"csr_staff"` and `"csr"` so CSR staff who can open the page can also call assign/remove actions
- Updated file-level MVP comment to name the full role set
- Added `revalidatePath("/manager/services")` to both `assignProviderToServiceAction` and `removeProviderFromServiceAction`

`src/app/(dashboard)/owner/branches/actions.ts` (updated):
- `requireOwnerOrBranchManager`: added `isSuperAdmin(user.id)` check before staff lookup
- Added `"csr_staff"` and `"csr"` to branch-scoped roles
- `updateBranchServiceEligibilityAction`: chained `.select("id, available_in_spa, available_home_service").maybeSingle()` — now returns `success: false` when no row is updated

`src/components/features/manager-settings/services-offered-tab.tsx` (updated):
- Added `localServices` state + `useEffect` to sync from `services` prop
- `activeServices` derived from `localServices` so optimistic updates render immediately
- `handleEligibilityChange` updates `localServices` on success before `router.refresh()`

**Intentionally Unchanged:** Booking logic, scheduling, public booking flow, DB schema.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing (all routes)

### 2026-05-28 — Claude (MVP-ROUTING-001 — Soft-pause Owner/Manager Workspaces, CRM as Main Command Center)

**Task:** Route all admin/management roles to /crm for MVP. Soft-pause /owner and /manager routes. Create typed CRM permission helpers. Hide Owner/Manager from workspace nav.

**Files Changed:**

`src/proxy.ts` (updated):
- `resolveWorkspace()`: owner, manager, assistant_manager, store_manager now resolve to `/crm` instead of `/owner`/`/manager`
- Access guard: owner/manager/assistant_manager/store_manager redirected to `/crm` if not on a `/crm` path (they no longer have cross-workspace bypass)

`src/lib/permissions.ts` (updated):
- `getDefaultDashboardPath()`: owner and management roles now return `/crm`; staff/therapist/masseuse/service_provider variants explicitly return `/staff-portal`

`src/app/(auth)/login/actions.ts` (updated):
- Dev bypass redirect changed from `/owner` to `/crm`

`src/app/(dashboard)/owner/layout.tsx` (updated):
- Replaced prefetch layout with a single `redirect("/crm")` — all /owner/* routes silently redirect to /crm. Files preserved.

`src/app/(dashboard)/manager/layout.tsx` (updated):
- Replaced prefetch layout with a single `redirect("/crm")` — all /manager/* routes silently redirect to /crm. Files preserved.

`src/lib/auth/crm-permissions.ts` (created):
- `CRM_WORKSPACE_ROLES` const and `CrmWorkspaceRole` type
- `canAccessCrmWorkspace`, `canManageCrmSetup`, `canManageServices`, `canManageBookings`, `canConfirmPayments`, `canManageCustomers`, `canManageStaffAssignments`, `canManageResources`, `canManageDispatch` — all typed helpers with MVP-correct access levels

`src/components/features/dashboard/nav-config.ts` (updated):
- `WorkspaceNav` type: added `mvpHidden?: boolean` flag
- Owner and Manager workspace entries marked `mvpHidden: true`
- `resolveWorkspaceKeyFromRole()`: owner/manager/assistant_manager/store_manager now resolve to `"crm"` (CRM nav and badge)

`src/components/features/dashboard/sidebar.tsx` (updated):
- Minor comment on `isManagerRoute` to note /manager now redirects (no logic change needed — role→workspace resolution already updated in nav-config)

**Behavior:**
- owner, manager, assistant_manager, store_manager → /crm on login and on any direct URL attempt
- /owner/* and /manager/* all silently redirect to /crm via layout.tsx
- Sidebar shows CRM nav and workspace badge for management roles
- Owner/Manager workspace nav entries exist but are `mvpHidden: true` (rendering layer can filter)
- CRM permission helpers available for new feature gates

**Intentionally NOT changed:**
- /owner/* and /manager/* page components (preserved for future restoration)
- Public booking flow
- Staff portal, driver portal
- Supabase schema, RLS, database queries

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 new errors; 4 pre-existing errors in services-offered-tab.tsx, staff-schedule-card.tsx, service-image.tsx not introduced by this task)

- `src/components/features/schedule/workspace/schedule-workspace-shell.tsx` — Unified shell with header, tabs, status chips, metric grid
- `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/schedule-setup-tab.tsx` — Now renders actual `ScheduleSetupWorkspace` via SWR
- `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/staff-schedule-tab.tsx` — Now renders actual `StaffSchedulePageClient` via SWR
- `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-workspace.tsx` — Added `showToolbar`, `showKpiCards`, `rightRailExtras` props (backward-compatible)
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/schedule-group-cards.tsx` — Enhanced active state styling (forest green), improved spacing
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/schedule-setup-right-rail.tsx` — Enhanced card styling with icon circles, consistent typography
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/schedule-setup-workspace.tsx` — Enhanced container grid, clickable setup flow breadcrumb
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/staff-schedule-page-client.tsx` — Stat strip now uses responsive grid

### 2026-05-28 — Kimi (READINESS-HEADER-001 — Replace Full-Width System Readiness Banner With Compact Header Indicator)

**Task:** Remove the persistent full-width System Readiness warning banner from workspace page content and replace it with a compact, premium readiness indicator in the shared header/topbar.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/dashboard/workspace-readiness-indicator.tsx` — compact rounded-full chip with icon, status text, issue count; opens a popover with full issue list, scope icons, problem descriptions, and action links; supports ok/warning/critical/unavailable states; keyboard accessible (Escape closes)

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/dashboard/header.tsx` — added optional `readiness?: ReadinessResult | null` prop; renders `WorkspaceReadinessIndicator` between date and notification bell
- `src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` — fetches `getCrmReadiness(branchId)` failure-safely and passes to `Header`; readiness query now runs once per dashboard layout render instead of per CRM page
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/layout.tsx` — removed `CrmReadinessBadgeWrapper` and old readiness banner from CRM content flow; layout now only renders route prefetcher
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/setup/page.tsx` — removed `SystemReadinessBar` import and render; removed now-unused `getCrmReadiness` call and readiness-derived variables; setup page content starts immediately after tab nav
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/availability/page.tsx` — removed `SystemReadinessBar` import and render; removed `buildAvailabilityReadinessIssues` and `buildReadinessResult` imports; removed availability-specific readiness variables; page content starts immediately after tab nav

**Behavior:**
- All CRM pages (`/crm/today`, `/crm/schedule`, `/crm/setup`, `/crm/availability`, `/crm/bookings`, `/crm/dispatch`, `/crm/services`, `/crm/spaces-rules`, `/crm/customers`, `/crm/staff-applications`, `/crm/staff-availability`) no longer have a full-width readiness banner pushing content down.
- A compact 32px-tall rounded-full chip appears in the shared header next to the notification bell.
- Chip states:
  - `System Ready` (green, ✅) when no issues
  - `System: N issues` (amber, ⚠️) when warnings exist
  - `Critical: N issues` (red, ⛔) when critical issues exist
  - `Unavailable` (muted, ⚠️) when readiness query fails
- Clicking the chip opens a popover listing every readiness issue with scope icon, title, problem description, count badge, and direct action link.
- Popover footer has an "Open Setup Center ›" link to `/crm/setup`.
- Accessibility: native `<button>` trigger, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, `aria-label`, keyboard focusable, Escape closes popover.
- Readiness detection logic (`getCrmReadiness`, `getCrmReadinessIssues`, all mappers) is completely unchanged.
- Business logic, RBAC, and auth are unchanged.

**Intentionally NOT changed:**
- `src/components/shared/system-readiness-bar.tsx` — component preserved (may be referenced by other unused components)
- `src/components/features/crm/readiness/crm-readiness-badge.tsx` — preserved but no longer imported
- `src/components/features/crm/readiness/crm-readiness-badge-wrapper.tsx` — preserved but no longer imported
- `src/components/features/schedule/crm-schedule-view.tsx` — still imports `SystemReadinessBar` but component is unused
- `src/components/features/crm/today/today-readiness-strip.tsx` — page-specific inline readiness strip on `/crm/today` is preserved (allowed by design rules)

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 new errors; 4 pre-existing warnings in unrelated files)

### 2026-05-29 — Claude (CRM-HOME-SVC-FIX-001 — Fix Home-Service Services Not Showing in Public Booking Wizard)

**Task:** Fix the bug where CRM enabling a service for Home Service did not result in it appearing in the public booking wizard.

**Root causes:**
1. `updateBranchServiceEligibilityAction` used `.select().maybeSingle()` and returned failure when 0 rows matched or data was null — causing UI to silently revert the toggle while the DB may not have been updated.
2. The action only revalidated CRM/owner/manager paths, not the public booking routes (`/`, `/services`, `/book`).
3. The `/api/public/booking-context` route had no `Cache-Control: no-store` header — browser could cache stale service data.
4. The Home Service toggle had no warning when the service was inactive or CSR-only, causing confusing "nothing shows up" after toggling.
5. Readiness checklist items had no guidance notes on how to fix failures.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/branches/actions.ts`
  - `updateBranchServiceEligibilityAction`: replaced `.select().maybeSingle()` with a plain update + separate existence check; added `/`, `/services`, `/book` revalidation
  - `updateBranchServiceDeliveryModeAction`: added `/`, `/services`, `/book` revalidation
- `src/app/api/public/booking-context/route.ts` — added `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` and `Cache-Control: no-store, must-revalidate` response header
- `src/components/features/crm/services/selected-service-editor-rail.tsx` — `HomeServiceToggleSection` now shows contextual warnings when service is inactive or not public; readiness checklist items show guidance notes
- `src/components/features/crm/services/service-customization-table.tsx` — `HomeServiceToggle` shows ⚠ indicator and tooltip when service is ON but won't appear publicly

### 2026-05-28 — Kimi (CRM-STAFF-UI-002 — Optimize Staff Popups, Drawers, and Service Capability Modals)

**Task:** Optimize all staff-related overlays in the CRM workspace: Edit Staff Profile drawer, Edit Service Capabilities modal, and staff service assignment popups.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/staff/staff-edit-form.tsx` — Added `onEditServices`, `formId`, `compact`, `onDirtyChange`, `onSuccess` props. Service checkbox grid is now hidden when `onEditServices` is provided; instead shows a compact summary (count + top 5 chips + "Edit Services" button). Inline Save button hidden in compact mode. Form gets `id` attribute for external footer submit.
- `src/components/features/crm/staff/crm-staff-management-tab.tsx` — Sheet restructured with fixed header, scrollable body (`flex-1 overflow-y-auto`), sticky footer with Cancel/Save buttons. Width narrowed to `sm:max-w-lg`. Added unsaved changes `AlertDialog` for the staff edit sheet. Passes `onEditServices` to open the service editor from the drawer. Tracks `editSheetDirty` state via `onDirtyChange`/`onSuccess`.
- `src/components/features/staff/staff-service-editor-sheet.tsx` — Service chips replaced with checkbox grid (1-col mobile, 2-col desktop). Each checkbox item shows service name + duration. Added `staffName` prop shown in header. Footer button text changed from "Done — N services selected" to "Save N services". Added unsaved changes `AlertDialog` when closing with modified selections. Added `onOpenChange` handler that captures baseline selections on open and checks for changes on close.
- `src/components/features/crm/staff/crm-staff-assignments-tab.tsx` — Passes `staffName` prop to `StaffServiceEditorSheet`.

**Behavior:**
- Staff Profile drawer is now narrow (max-w-lg), scrollable, with sticky footer. It no longer contains the full service checklist.
- Service capability editing opens in the dedicated wider modal with category accordions, search, and Selected tab.
- Closing either overlay with unsaved changes shows a confirmation dialog.
- Owner page (`owner/staff/[staffId]`) is unaffected — still shows full service checkboxes inline.

### 2026-05-28 — Kimi (CRM-MODAL-002 — Fix Service Capability Modal Scrolling)

**Task:** Fix the Edit Service Capabilities modal so all services are reachable by internal scroll, the footer never covers content, and the page behind the modal does not scroll.

**Root Cause:**
1. `AdminDialog` was vertically centered with `top-1/2 left-1/2 translate-x/y-1/2`. For tall content, centering caused the popup to push against viewport edges and the inner flex body's `overflow-y-auto` scrollbar to be clipped or ineffective.
2. `staff-service-editor-sheet.tsx` used a stacked accordion layout where every category rendered into the same scroll column. When one category with 50+ services expanded, the scrollable body became taller than the allocated flex space, but the scrollbar was not reliably usable because the flex parent height was not definite.
3. The body had `pb-24` padding-bottom hack attempting to clear a footer that was already `shrink-0` in the flex column, meaning the padding was unnecessary and browser handling of bottom padding in overflow containers is inconsistent.
4. Dozens of inline `style={{...}}` props throughout the file made layout debugging fragile and violated project style rules.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/shared/overlays/admin-dialog.tsx` — Changed positioning from `top-1/2 left-1/2 translate-x/y-1/2` to `top-6 left-1/2 translate-x-1/2`. Added explicit `h-auto max-h-[calc(100dvh-3rem)]` so the flex column has a definite, viewport-safe height. Close button remains absolute.
- `src/components/features/staff/staff-service-editor-sheet.tsx` — Complete rewrite of internal layout:
  - Replaced stacked accordion with split-pane layout: fixed 220px category rail on the left, scrollable service list panel on the right.
  - `AdminOverlayBody` now uses `overflow-hidden p-0 flex flex-col`. Inside it, a responsive flex/grid wrapper (`flex flex-1 min-h-0 flex-col sm:grid sm:grid-cols-[220px_1fr]`) creates the split.
  - Category rail: `shrink-0 sm:min-h-0 overflow-x-auto sm:overflow-y-auto` with selection badges.
  - Service list panel: `min-h-0 flex-1 overflow-y-auto` with two-column checkbox grid.
  - Only the active category's services render in the right panel (not all categories at once).
  - Search mode bypasses the rail and shows all matching services grouped by category in the right panel.
  - Selected mode shows only selected services grouped by category in the right panel.
  - Added Cancel button to footer alongside Save button.
  - Replaced `baselineRef` (ref read in render) with `baselineIds` state to avoid React ref-in-render errors.
  - Removed all inline `style={{...}}` props; everything now uses Tailwind utilities via `cn()`.
  - Size changed from `xl` to `wide` (1080px) to give the split pane adequate horizontal room.

### 2026-05-29 — Claude (BOOKING-PASTSLOT-001 — Same-Day Past Slot Filtering)

**Task:** Fix booking wizard showing past time slots when customer selects today.

**Root Cause:**
`isPastSlot` constructed slot datetimes via `new Date(y, m-1, d, hh, mm, ss)` using
the server's OS timezone (UTC on cloud hosts). Slot times represent branch local time
(Philippines = UTC+8). A "13:00" Manila slot was treated as 13:00 UTC = 9 PM Manila —
far in the future — so it was never filtered even when 2 PM Manila had already passed.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/engine/slot-time.ts`
  - Added `BRANCH_TIMEZONE = "Asia/Manila"` export.
  - Added private `getBranchTime(now, timezone)` using `Intl.DateTimeFormat`.
  - Updated `isPastSlot` and `filterPastSlotsForDate` to accept optional `timezone`.
  - Legacy callers without `timezone` keep existing server-local-time behavior; all tests pass.
- `src/lib/engine/availability.ts`
  - Imports `BRANCH_TIMEZONE`.
  - `getAvailableSlots`: passes `timezone: BRANCH_TIMEZONE` to `filterPastSlotsForDate`.
  - `getAvailableSlotsMulti`: stores qualified slots, then applies `filterPastSlotsForDate` with timezone as final pass.
- `src/lib/actions/online-booking.ts`
  - `createOnlineBookingMultiAction`: explicit `isPastSlot` guard after rules check — returns `SLOT_IN_PAST` with clear error message before attempting staff assignment.
- `src/components/public/booking-wizard.tsx`
  - `handleSubmit`: client-side `isPastSlot` guard — clears selection, shows error, navigates back to date/time step.

**Acceptance criteria met:**
- Past slots hidden for today (server-side, timezone-correct).
- Future slots visible normally.
- Past dates return empty slot list.
- Home-service and in-spa both use the same engine path.
- Stale-slot submission rejected server-side with clear error.
- Stale-slot caught client-side before submission, with selection cleared.
- No DB schema changes. No new dependencies. TypeScript strict.

### 2026-05-29 — Codex (CRM-SCHEDULE-AVAILABILITY-001 — Centered Edit Availability Modal)

**Task:** Build a centralized, centered CRM Edit Availability modal from the Schedule page staff details panel and Staff Schedule tab.

**What Changed:**
- Added a centered `AdminDialog` placement while preserving the existing top-anchored default for other admin overlays.
- Added CRM schedule availability modal components:
  - `edit-availability-modal.tsx`
  - `edit-availability-header.tsx`
  - `edit-availability-summary.tsx`
  - `weekly-hours-editor-table.tsx`
  - `day-overrides-editor-tab.tsx`
  - `block-time-editor-tab.tsx`
  - `edit-availability-footer.tsx`
  - shared types/utils
- Loaded branch staff availability on `/crm/schedule` and passed it into both:
  - Daily Timeline staff details panel
  - `/crm/schedule?tab=staff`
- Replaced the Daily Timeline `Edit Availability` link to `/crm/staff-availability` with an in-place modal trigger.
- Replaced the Staff Schedule tab side sheet with the same centered modal.
- Added focused weekly-hours batch server action for CRM schedule editing:
  - Authenticates the user.
  - Allows existing operational schedule roles.
  - Verifies branch scope and staff branch membership.
  - Validates seven weekly rows with Zod.
  - Upserts only `staff_schedules` rows for `shift_type = "single"`.
  - Revalidates CRM/manager schedule and availability paths.
- Preserved existing day override and block-time logic by reusing current create/delete actions.
- Expanded existing schedule action revalidation to include `/crm/schedule` and `/manager/schedule`.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 2 pre-existing script warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing (89/89 routes)
- Browser: ⚠️ Local authenticated CRM routes redirect to `/login` in the currently running dev server, so modal click-through could not be completed without a valid session.

### 2026-05-29 — Kimi (CRM-SCHEDULE-AVAILABILITY-002 — Unblock CRM Edit Availability Modal)

**Task:** Diagnose and fix why the CRM Edit Availability modal was blocked for operational staff schedule editing.

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. **RLS policies too strict:** Existing RLS on `staff_schedules`, `schedule_overrides`, `blocked_times`, and `staff` only allowed `manager` and `owner`. CRM, CSR Head, CSR Staff, CSR, assistant_manager, and store_manager had no write (and CRM/CSR had no read) access to branch staff schedules. This caused:
   - `getStaffWithAvailability` to return only the CRM user's own record (because `staff` table had no CRM branch-read policy).
   - Day Overrides and Block Time tab saves to fail silently because they reuse `manager/staff/actions.ts` which uses the regular Supabase client subject to RLS.
2. **Permission guards too narrow:** `SCHEDULE_EDIT_ROLES` in both `crm-schedule-availability.ts` and `manager/staff/actions.ts` excluded `csr_staff` and `csr`.
3. **CRM weekly action bypassed RLS:** `updateCrmStaffWeeklyAvailabilityAction` used `createAdminClient()` (service role) instead of the regular client. This masked the RLS problem for weekly hours but created an inconsistency and reduced defense-in-depth.

**Files Changed:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260529000002_crm_csr_schedule_rls.sql` (NEW)
  - Added `staff_operational_read_branch` policy so CRM/CSR/assistant_manager/store_manager can read branch staff.
  - Replaced manager-only `staff_schedules` policies with `staff_schedules_operational_read/insert/update` covering all operational roles.
  - Replaced manager-only `schedule_overrides_manager_all` with `schedule_overrides_operational_all`.
  - Replaced manager-only `blocked_times_manager_all` with `blocked_times_operational_all`.
- `src/lib/actions/crm-schedule-availability.ts`
  - Expanded `SCHEDULE_EDIT_ROLES` to include `csr_staff` and `csr`.
  - Switched from `createAdminClient()` to `createClient()` for defense-in-depth (RLS now enforces branch scope as a second layer).
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/staff/actions.ts`
  - Expanded `SCHEDULE_EDIT_ROLES` to include `csr_staff` and `csr`.
- `src/lib/permissions.ts`
  - Updated `canAdjustStaffSchedule()` to include `isCsrStaff(role)` (`csr_staff` + `csr`).

**Behavior:**
- CRM and all front-desk roles can now read all branch staff and their schedules through RLS.
- CRM/CSR/assistant_manager/store_manager can create/update `staff_schedules`, `schedule_overrides`, and `blocked_times` for staff in their assigned branch.
- Weekly Hours, Day Overrides, and Block Time tabs all use the same permission model and RLS enforcement.
- Owner and manager access remain unchanged.
- No database schema changes (only RLS policy additions/replacements).

### 2026-05-29 — Kimi (CRM-STAFF-PROFILE-SAVE-002 — Final Fix)

**Task:** Diagnose and fix why CRM/CSR user `86ce597a-2e35-4741-8394-fa84fc21c00e` could not save staff profile edits.

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. **RLS migration not applied:** The `staff_operational_update_branch` UPDATE policy did not exist in production. The previous migration file was modified but `supabase db push` could not connect, so the policy was never applied. CRM/CSR `UPDATE` on `staff` was silently blocked by RLS (no error, just 0 rows affected).
2. **Silent failure in server action:** `updateStaffAction` used `.update().eq("id", staffId)` without `.select()`. When RLS blocks an UPDATE, Supabase returns `error: null, status: 204`, so the action returned `{ success: true }` even though nothing was saved.
3. **Missing `nickname` field:** The server action's `updatePayload` did not include `nickname`, so even when updates worked, nickname changes were silently dropped.
4. **Same silent-failure pattern in `toggleStaffActiveAction`:** Also lacked `.select()` and 0-row detection.

**Affected User Verified:**
- Staff ID: `74e12b49-e011-492d-8da5-23aa293454f3`
- Auth user ID: `86ce597a-2e35-4741-8394-fa84fc21c00e` ✅ correctly linked
- Role: `csr_staff` ✅ operational role
- Branch: `c1000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001` (Cradle Massage & Wellness Spa) ✅ present
- is_active: `true` ✅

**Files Changed:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260529000003_crm_csr_staff_update_rls.sql` (NEW)
  - Idempotent migration adding `staff_operational_update_branch` UPDATE policy for operational roles on staff in their branch.
  - Idempotent migration adding `staff_services_operational_all` ALL policy for operational roles on `staff_services`, replacing `staff_services_manager_all`.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/staff/actions.ts`
  - Fixed `updateStaffAction` to chain `.select("id")` after `.update()` and verify `data.length > 0`. RLS blocks now return a clear error instead of fake success.
  - Added `nickname` to the `updatePayload` (was completely missing).
  - Added `driver` and `utility` to `MANAGER_SAFE_ROLES`.
  - Fixed `toggleStaffActiveAction` with the same `.select("id")` + 0-row detection pattern.

**Behavior:**
- CRM/CSR operational roles can now UPDATE staff records in their branch through RLS (after migration is applied).
- Server actions return real errors when RLS blocks an update or the row is missing.
- Nickname changes are now persisted.
- `driver` and `utility` role assignments are no longer blocked for managers/CRM.
- Owner and manager access remain unchanged.

### 2026-05-29 — Kimi (CRM-EDIT-STAFF-PROFILE-MODAL — Drawer to Modal Conversion)

**Task:** Convert the CRM Edit Staff Profile drawer into a centered modal matching the newer centralized modal style, and ensure CRM-safe staff profile saving works end-to-end.

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. **UI was a right-side drawer:** `CrmStaffManagementTab` used `AdminDrawer` for Edit Profile, inconsistent with the newer centered modal pattern used for Edit Availability.
2. **Inline styles throughout:** `StaffEditForm` had extensive inline `style={{}}` props violating project rules.
3. **Silent failure on RLS block:** `updateStaffAction` returned `{ success: true }` even when RLS silently blocked the UPDATE (0 rows affected, no error from Supabase client).
4. **Missing `nickname` field:** The server action's `updatePayload` did not include `nickname`, so nickname edits were silently dropped.
5. **Validation schema too narrow:** `updateStaffSchema` excluded valid manager-assignable roles `service_head`, `service_staff`, and `utility`.
6. **Migration not applied:** `staff_operational_update_branch` RLS policy never reached production because `supabase db push` timed out.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/crm/staff/crm-edit-staff-profile-modal.tsx` (NEW)
  - Centered `AdminDialog` with `placement="center"`, `size="lg"`.
  - Staff identity summary card with `UserAvatar`, name, role, tier, status, branch.
  - Sectioned form layout: Basic Information, Work Setup, Access & Status, Service Capabilities.
  - 2-column grid on desktop (`sm:grid-cols-2`).
  - Tailwind-only styling, zero inline styles.
  - `useActionState` with `updateStaffAction`, keyed `ModalContent` (remounts per staff ID) to reset form state cleanly.
  - Unsaved changes protection with `ConfirmUnsavedChangesDialog`.
  - Edit Services integration: warns about unsaved changes before opening the dedicated Service Capabilities modal.
  - Protected role detection: disables all fields for sensitive system roles with a clear warning banner.
  - Branch field disabled for CRM with explanatory text.
  - System role dropdown uses `getSystemRoleOptionsForAssigner(reviewerSystemRole)` for safe role assignment.
- `src/components/features/crm/staff/crm-staff-management-tab.tsx`
  - Replaced `AdminDrawer` + `StaffEditForm` with `CrmEditStaffProfileModal`.
  - Removed unused overlay imports (`AdminDrawer`, `AdminOverlayHeader`, etc.).
  - Cleaned up state management for the modal flow.
- `src/components/features/crm/staff/crm-staff-workspace.tsx`
  - Passed `reviewerSystemRole` prop through to `CrmStaffManagementTab`.
- `src/lib/validations/staff.ts`
  - Expanded `systemRole` enum in both `createStaffSchema` and `updateStaffSchema` to include `service_head`, `service_staff`, and `utility`.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/staff/actions.ts`
  - Added `.select("id")` after `.update()` in `updateStaffAction` and `toggleStaffActiveAction`.
  - Added 0-row detection: returns explicit error when RLS blocks the update.
  - Added missing `nickname` to `updatePayload`.
  - Added `driver` and `utility` to `MANAGER_SAFE_ROLES`.
- `supabase/migrations/20260529000003_crm_csr_staff_update_rls.sql` (NEW)
  - Idempotent migration adding `staff_operational_update_branch` UPDATE policy.
  - Idempotent migration adding `staff_services_operational_all` ALL policy for `staff_services`.

**Behavior:**
- CRM/CSR opens a centered Edit Staff Profile modal from `/crm/staff?tab=management`.
- Modal has fixed header, scrollable body, sticky footer.
- All fields use Tailwind classes; no inline styles.
- CRM can edit: full_name, nickname, phone, staff_type, tier, is_head, is_active.
- CRM can assign only manager-safe system roles (uses `getSystemRoleOptionsForAssigner`).
- CRM cannot edit branch (disabled with explanation).
- CRM cannot edit protected accounts (owner, manager, etc.) — fields disabled with red banner.
- Service capabilities show summary only; Edit Services opens the existing `StaffServiceEditorSheet`.
- Unsaved changes trigger a confirmation dialog on close or Edit Services click.
- Save failures surface real errors inline; success closes modal and refreshes staff table.
- Server actions return explicit errors on RLS blocks instead of fake success.

### 2026-05-30 — Claude (CRM-BACKEND-STAB-001 — CRM/CSR Operational Backend Stabilization)

**Task:** Full backend/RLS audit and stabilization so CRM/CSR can run daily operations without hidden DB failures.

**Phase 1 — Silent failure fixes (code only, no DB changes):**
- `crm/actions.ts` `updateCustomerAction`: added `.select("id")` + 0-row detection
- `crm/bookings/actions.ts` `confirmBookingPaymentAction`: added `.select("id")` on primary + 42703-fallback booking update paths
- `crm/waitlist/actions.ts` `updateWaitlistStatusAction`: added `.select("id")` + 0-row detection
- `crm/reconciliation/actions.ts` `approveReconciliationAction`: added `.select("id")` + 0-row detection

**Phase 2 — RLS migrations (created and applied to live DB):**
- `20260530000001_crm_operational_rls_bookings.sql` — `crm` role INSERT+UPDATE on bookings (branch-scoped)
- `20260530000002_crm_operational_rls_customers.sql` — `crm`+`csr_*` UPDATE on customers (scoped via bookings)
- `20260530000003_crm_operational_rls_resources.sql` — fix `branch_resources` cross-branch read; add crm+csr_head UPDATE
- `20260530000004_crm_operational_rls_misc.sql` — public→authenticated tightening; csr_staff booking_events read; crm onboarding read

**Phase 3 — Guard fixes:**
- `lib/actions/crm-schedule-availability.ts`: `getScheduleEditContext` now returns typed specific error per failure mode; branch UUID comparison now case-insensitive (fixes Zod v4 `z.guid()` case preservation)
- `lib/actions/crm-staff-services.ts`: `z.string().uuid()` → `z.guid()` for Zod v4 compat

**Browser verification:**
- Staff profile edit (csr_staff): ✅ PASS
- Service assignment (csr_staff): ✅ PASS
- Schedule update (csr_staff): ✅ PASS
- Customer update (csr_staff): ✅ PASS
- Booking operations (csr_staff): ✅ PASS
- Owner regression: ✅ PASS

**Remaining deferred:**
- `booking_payment_logs` broad access: business decision, intentional
- `departments` table: separate cleanup needed (backup + FK check)
- Unused schedule helper tables: candidates for archival, do NOT drop without approval

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 2 pre-existing script warnings)

- `src/components/features/crm/customers/customer-preview-rail.tsx` — right preview rail with contact, stats, activity, notes
- `src/components/features/crm/customers/customers-workspace.tsx` — main workspace orchestrator

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/customers/page.tsx` — unified server component fetching tab-specific data + KPIs
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/repeats/page.tsx` — redirect to `/crm/customers?tab=repeat`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/lapsed/page.tsx` — redirect to `/crm/customers?tab=lapsed`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/waitlist/page.tsx` — redirect to `/crm/customers?tab=followup`
- `src/components/features/crm/crm-tab-nav.tsx` — updated `CUSTOMERS_TABS` to 4 tabs; removed waitlist from `BOOKINGS_TABS`

**Design Decisions:**
- Single workspace at `/crm/customers?tab={all|repeat|lapsed|followup}` with server-side data fetching per tab.
- Old routes (`/crm/repeats`, `/crm/lapsed`, `/crm/waitlist`) redirect to unified tab URLs.
- Right preview rail fetches full customer profile + bookings on selection via existing `getCustomerProfileAction`.
- Notes can be saved inline in the rail via existing `updateCustomerAction` with green success toast.
- Waitlist actions use existing `updateWaitlistStatusAction` with `useTransition` for inline loading and `sonner` toasts.
- Mobile rail renders as a Sheet; desktop rail is a sticky 340px sidebar.
- No inline styles — all components use Tailwind + `cn()`.
- KPI data is derived safely from existing customer/bookings/waitlist queries.

### 2026-05-30 — Claude (CRM-MOTION-001 — Install motion + real animation layer for CRM premium components)

**Task:** Install motion 12 (modern Framer Motion), create shared variants, and upgrade CRM premium components from CSS-only animations to proper motion.

**Dependency added:**
- `motion` 12.40.0 — import path `motion/react`

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/crm/premium/variants.ts` — shared motion variants (sectionVariants, itemVariants, railVariants, emptyStateVariants, TAB_INDICATOR_SPRING, CS_EASE) + reduced-motion "still" counterparts

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/crm/premium/crm-motion-section.tsx` — motion.div + real staggerChildren; useReducedMotion; falls back to plain div
- `src/components/features/crm/premium/crm-kpi-card.tsx` — motion.div stagger child (itemVariants); whileHover y:-2 lift; useReducedMotion
- `src/components/features/crm/premium/crm-segment-tabs.tsx` — motion.span with layoutId="crm-tab-indicator" spring slide; LayoutGroup scoped per instance via useId(); useReducedMotion fallback to plain span
- `src/components/features/crm/premium/crm-preview-rail-shell.tsx` — AnimatePresence + motion.aside spring slide-in/exit (railVariants); useReducedMotion
- `src/components/features/crm/premium/crm-empty-state.tsx` — motion.div fade-up entrance; useReducedMotion
- `src/components/features/crm/premium/crm-table-row.tsx` — motion.tr per-row entrance delay (40ms × index, capped 280ms); useReducedMotion
- `src/components/features/crm/premium/index.ts` — re-exports variants.ts

**Design Decisions:**
- `@number-flow/react` skipped — CountUpNumber is adequate for static server-fetched KPIs (values don't change after page load, Math.round issue only appears on value-change animations which don't occur here).
- All shadcn/ui components needed (button, sheet, dropdown-menu, etc.) were already installed. Zero new shadcn installs needed.
- CSS classes `crm-fade-up` and `crm-row-enter` remain in globals.css as non-breaking legacy — they are no longer used by the premium components but do not cause any issues.
- Stagger works correctly: CrmMotionSection sets staggerChildren on its motion.div, CrmKpiCard uses itemVariants as a stagger child. When CrmKpiCard is a direct child of CrmMotionSection, each card animates 50ms after the previous one.
- LayoutGroup per CrmSegmentTabs instance (useId()) prevents cross-component layoutId conflicts when multiple tab bars exist on the same page.
- All motion code respects useReducedMotion() — reduced-motion users get instant/no animation with identical visual result.

### 2026-05-30 — Claude (CRM-LOADER-001 — Kokonut Loader integration into CRM premium system)

**Task:** Install Kokonut loader via shadcn CLI, adapt it to CradleHub theme, and integrate as a premium full-section loader working alongside (not replacing) the existing skeleton shimmer system.

**Install:**
- `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add @kokonutui/loader` → created `src/components/kokonutui/loader.tsx`
- No new npm dependency added (motion already installed)

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/crm/premium/crm-premium-loader.tsx` — CRM-themed wrapper around Kokonut loader. Changes from source: all ring conic-gradient colors use var(--cs-sand/--cs-sand-dark/--cs-border); 4 dark:block ring duplicates removed; text uses var(--cs-text/--cs-text-muted); useReducedMotion respected (static border rings fallback); role="status" + aria-live="polite"; inline styles kept only for conic-gradient + radial-gradient mask (cannot be expressed as Tailwind)
- `src/components/features/crm/premium/crm-loading-state.tsx` — combined CrmPremiumLoader + optional CrmLoadingShimmer below it. Props: title, subtitle, loaderSize, shimmer ("kpi-row"|"table"|"rail"|"card-grid"|"none"), rows, cols

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/crm/premium/index.ts` — exports CrmPremiumLoader, CrmPremiumLoaderProps, CrmLoadingState, CrmLoadingStateProps
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/setup/loading.tsx` — now uses CrmLoadingState (title: "Checking setup readiness...", shimmer: card-grid, cols: 4)
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/loading.tsx` — now uses CrmLoadingState (title: "Preparing CRM workspace...", shimmer: kpi-row, cols: 4)
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/customers/loading.tsx` — warm skeleton preserved; small CrmPremiumLoader (size="sm") added between KPI shimmer and table shimmer

**Small actions NOT touched:**
- CrmInlineActionButton unchanged
- All row/button/toggle/modal save loading patterns unchanged
- PremiumSuccessToast unchanged

### 2026-05-30 — Claude (CRM-SERVICES-EDIT-001 — Reuse Edit Staff Profile modal in Services Provider Assignment)

**Task:** Wire the existing CrmEditStaffProfileModal (from Staff Management) into the Services Provider Assignments tab so staff profiles can be edited from both places using the same modal.

**Audit findings:**
- Existing modal: `src/components/features/crm/staff/crm-edit-staff-profile-modal.tsx`
- Already used by: `CrmStaffManagementTab` via `handleEditStaff` / `onEditStaff` pattern
- Provider Assignment tab: `CrmStaffCapabilitiesTab` (tab id "providers") had `<Link href="/manager/staff/${id}">Edit Profile ›</Link>` — navigated away from the CRM
- `StaffForServicePanel` type was missing: nickname, phone, branch_id, tier, is_head, is_active, avatar_url, branches

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/queries/crm-services.ts` — Extended `StaffForServicePanel` type with modal-required fields; extended SELECT to fetch `nickname, phone, branch_id, tier, is_head, is_active, avatar_url, branches(id, name)`; used `as unknown as StaffForServicePanel[]` cast (Supabase inferred type for the complex select string doesn't overlap directly)
- `src/components/features/crm/services/crm-staff-capabilities-tab.tsx` — Removed `import Link from "next/link"`; added optional `onEditProfile?: (member: StaffForServicePanel) => void` prop; replaced `<Link>` with `<button>` that calls `onEditProfile(member)` (renders null if prop not provided)
- `src/components/features/crm/services/crm-services-workspace.tsx` — Added `reviewerSystemRole: string` prop; added `editingStaff` state; added `toStaffMember` mapper (StaffForServicePanel → StaffMember with null defaults for unused fields); added `serviceRows` useMemo (toCrmStaffServiceRows); added `branchOptions` useMemo (single branch); added `editingStaffServiceIds` computed from providerAssignments; added `handleEditProfile` and `handleEditSuccess` callbacks; renders `CrmEditStaffProfileModal` once; passes `onEditProfile` to `CrmStaffCapabilitiesTab`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/services/page.tsx` — Added `reviewerSystemRole: me.system_role` to return value; passed to `CrmServicesWorkspace`

**Design decisions:**
- Modal lifted to `CrmServicesWorkspace` — same pattern as `CrmStaffManagementTab` (tab fires callback, parent orchestrator manages modal)
- `onEditServices` in the modal closes the modal (user is already on Services page, can manage assignments directly)
- Single branch passed to modal — CRM/CSR cannot change branches (modal hides branch dropdown for non-owner/manager reviewers)
- No new server actions, no new modal component, no RLS/auth changes

### 2026-05-31 — Claude (CRM-SERVICES-TABS-001 — Convert Services route-link tabs to internal workspace tabs)

**Task:** Convert /crm/services from route-link tabs (CrmTabNav) to instant internal workspace tabs without changing backend, auth, or data fetching.

**Root cause:** page.tsx was rendering CrmTabNav (route-link pills) ABOVE CrmServicesWorkspace, which already had its own internal button tab bar. Clicking the CrmTabNav pills triggered full Next.js soft-navigation → full page reload + loading.tsx flash. The internal workspace tabs were already instant but not exposed as the primary UI.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/services/page.tsx`
  - Removed `import { CrmTabNav, CRM_SERVICES_TABS }` — no longer needed
  - Removed `<CrmTabNav ...>` JSX — the route-link pills are gone
  - `initialTab` resolver kept intact — deep links still work via server `searchParams`

- `src/components/features/crm/services/crm-services-workspace.tsx`
  - Removed hand-rolled inline `<div>` + `<button>` tab bar
  - Added `CrmSegmentTabs` from the CRM premium layer (underline variant, consistent with Customers workspace)
  - Added `SEGMENT_TABS: CrmSegmentTab[]` config and `TAB_URL_PARAM` map
  - Added `handleTabChange(nextTab)` callback: sets `activeTab` state instantly + calls `window.history.replaceState` to update URL without triggering Next.js navigation
  - `onSelect={handleTabChange}` wired to `CrmSegmentTabs`

**URL sync approach:** `window.history.replaceState` (not `router.replace`) because `router.replace` triggers Next.js soft-navigation which would refetch server data. The `TAB_URL_PARAM` map ensures the canonical `?tab=` values match what the server's `initialTab` resolver expects:
  - `readiness_issues` → `?tab=issues` (consistent with existing deep links in codebase)

**Deep links:** All `?tab=` params continue to work. Server reads `searchParams.tab`, computes `initialTab`, passes it to `CrmServicesWorkspace` as the initial `useState` value. After page load, tab switches are instant via client state.

**Preserved:**
- ProviderAssignmentSheet, service toggles, provider assignment save actions
- CrmEditStaffProfileModal (wired at workspace level in previous task)
- All actionHref links in readiness/provider components pointing to `/crm/services?tab=...`
- router.refresh() after saves (reloads data after mutations — acceptable)

### 2026-05-31 — Claude (CRM-SETUP-UNIFIED-001 — Unified Setup Center in-page workspace)

**Task:** Convert /crm/setup, /crm/services, /crm/spaces-rules into one unified in-page workspace at /crm/setup with instant tab switching.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/crm/setup/crm-setup-workspace.tsx` — Client orchestrator. 7 tabs: health, services, providers, spaces, booking_rules, staff_readiness, public_readiness. Uses CrmSegmentTabs + window.history.replaceState. No full page reload on tab switch.
- `src/components/features/crm/setup/crm-staff-readiness-panel.tsx` — Simple staff readiness summary panel using preloaded health data.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/setup/page.tsx` — Major rewrite. Loads all data (health + services + staff-assignments + branch-detail + booking-rules + bookings) in parallel. Passes data as props to CrmSetupWorkspace. SetupHealthContent passed as a `healthSlot` RSC slot. Added `resolveTab()` mapping old URL params to internal SetupTab values.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/services/page.tsx` — Converted to compatibility redirect. Maps old ?tab= params to /crm/setup?tab=... (services/customization→services, providers→providers, issues→public_readiness).
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/spaces-rules/page.tsx` — Converted to compatibility redirect. Always redirects to /crm/setup?tab=spaces.
- `src/components/features/spaces-rules/spaces-rules-workspace.tsx` — Added optional `initialTab?: SpacesRulesTab` prop. `useState` now uses `initialTab ?? "overview"`.
- `src/components/features/crm/crm-tab-nav.tsx` — SETUP_TABS updated to point directly to /crm/setup?tab=... (avoids extra redirect hop).

**Design decisions:**
- `SetupHealthContent` is a Server Component; passed as `healthSlot: React.ReactNode` from the server page to the client workspace — the standard Next.js RSC slot pattern.
- Services-related tabs (services, providers, public_readiness) each mount `CrmServicesWorkspace` with `key={activeTab}` to force remount and start on correct inner tab.
- Spaces-related tabs (spaces, booking_rules) each mount `SpacesRulesWorkspace` with `key={activeTab}` and `initialTab`.
- `allServices` prop in CrmServicesWorkspace is confirmed unused — passed as `[]` to avoid extra query.
- Old route files kept as redirects (not deleted) to preserve deep links from notifications, today queue, setup health cards, nav links, etc.
- revalidatePath calls in actions still revalidate /crm/services and /crm/setup — those paths still exist as real routes (one redirects, one is the unified page). Both revalidations remain correct.

### 2026-05-31 — Codex (CRM-STAFF-TABS-001 — Fast internal Staff workspace tabs)

**Task:** Convert `/crm/staff` from route-link tabs to true in-page workspace tabs.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/staff/page.tsx`
- `src/components/features/crm/staff/crm-staff-workspace.tsx`
- `src/components/features/crm/crm-tab-nav.tsx`

**Behavior:**
- Removed Staff's rendered `CrmTabNav` route-link tab bar.
- `CrmStaffWorkspace` now owns `activeTab` client-side and uses `CrmSegmentTabs` button tabs.
- Tab switches update `?tab=` via `window.history.replaceState`, preserving unrelated URL params without triggering Next.js route navigation.
- Direct deep links still resolve through the server page's `searchParams.tab` and pass `initialTab` into the workspace.
- Management, Service Assignments, Status, and Applications panels stay mounted and are hidden when inactive.
- Onboarding requests are still permission-gated, but now preload for users who can review onboarding so the Applications tab can switch internally.
- Existing Staff profile edit modal, service capabilities sheet, activate/deactivate action, `router.refresh()`, and success toasts were preserved.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: Passing
- `pnpm lint`: Passing with 2 pre-existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`

### 2026-05-31 — Codex (NOTIF-BELL-READABLE-001 — Business-readable bell popover)

**Task:** Simplify the notification bell popover into one business-readable notification list.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/notifications/notification-display.ts` — Display mapper that turns raw workspace notifications into title, detail, meta, action label, tone, href, and icon metadata.
- `src/components/features/notifications/notification-popover-row.tsx` — Bell-only notification row with Lucide icons, unread dot, primary action, mark-read, and dismiss controls.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/notifications/notification-bell.tsx` — Replaced manual absolute dropdown/outside-click shell with existing Popover primitive; preserved unread count polling, visibility pause behavior, fetch-on-open behavior, and `BookingNotificationSound`.
- `src/components/features/notifications/notification-popover.tsx` — Removed category tabs from the bell popover; replaced Action Required/Updates/Resolved/Activity buckets with one newest-first scrollable list, unread badge, Mark all read, warm skeleton rows, empty state, and footer link.
- `.context/CURRENT_TASK.cmd.md` — Marked task in progress, then done.
- `.context/DECISIONS.cmd.md` — Added notification bell list decision.
- `.context/HANDOFF.cmd.md` — Added implementation and verification notes.

**Behavior:**
- Bell popover now shows one list, newest first.
- Rows explain what happened, who/what is affected, when it happened, and the next action using safe metadata/body fallbacks.
- Existing notification creation, database schema, RLS, auth, notification queries/actions, unread count, mark-read, mark-all-read, dismiss behavior, and notification sound were preserved.
- Full notification pages were not redesigned; `notification-tabs.tsx`, `notification-row.tsx`, `notification-card.tsx`, and `notification-list-client.tsx` remain available for the notification center.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: Passing
- `pnpm lint`: Passing with 2 pre-existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`

### 2026-06-03 - Codex (CRM-BOOKINGS-WORKFLOW-001 - Booking workflow tabs, modals, and callback follow-up)

**Task:** Convert CRM Bookings into an operational workflow surface with in-page tabs, centralized booking action modals, room assignment actions, and embedded callback follow-up.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/bookings/booking-followup-modal.tsx` - centralized Booking Follow-up modal.
- `src/components/features/bookings/customer-arrived-modal.tsx` - Customer Arrived confirmation modal.
- `src/components/features/bookings/room-assignment-modal.tsx` - Assign Room / Change Room modal using branch resource availability.
- `src/components/features/bookings/callback-followup-panel.tsx` - Bookings callback follow-up tab wrapper around the existing waitlist table.
- `src/lib/bookings/crm-booking-status.ts` - shared CRM booking status grouping helpers.
- `src/lib/bookings/revalidate-booking-surfaces.ts` - shared booking surface/cache revalidation helper.
- `tests/lib/bookings/crm-booking-status.test.ts` - focused coverage for CRM booking status grouping.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/bookings/bookings-workspace.tsx` - added workflow tabs: Needs Confirmation, Confirmed, Waiting / Arrived, In Service, Completed, Callback Follow-up.
- `src/components/features/bookings/bookings-table.tsx` - lifted booking actions into centralized modals and added next-action panel behavior.
- `src/components/features/bookings/crm-bookings-view.tsx` - added SWR tab payload handling, `bookingId`/legacy `highlight` deep-link support, and mutation refresh.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/bookings/actions.ts` - added CRM confirm/follow-up/arrival/room assignment server actions.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/bookings/page.tsx` and `src/app/api/crm/bookings/route.ts` - added tab-aware fetching and callback follow-up data.
- `src/lib/queries/bookings.ts` and `src/lib/queries/booking-resources.ts` - added delivery/branch/resource details and pending queue support.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/waitlist/actions.ts` - branch-guarded waitlist updates and broader CRM revalidation.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/today/page.tsx` and CRM Today components - added pending/incoming queue visibility and canonical booking deep links.
- Booking creation/status/payment actions - moved booking surface revalidation through the shared helper.

**Behavior:**
- CRM Bookings now opens as an operational workflow with tab-level counts and URL-synced `?tab=`.
- Pending/incoming bookings include `pending`, `pending_payment`, and `pending_crm_confirmation`.
- Booking Follow-up supports Confirmed, No Answer, Reschedule, Confirm Later, note capture, follow-up time, and cancellation.
- Customer Arrived marks in-spa bookings as `booking_progress_status = "checked_in"`.
- Room assignment uses the existing resource availability engine and excludes closed/home-service bookings.
- Callback Follow-up is available directly inside Bookings and reuses the existing waitlist follow-up table.
- Today queue links now use `bookingId` instead of `highlight`; legacy `highlight` still resolves in Bookings.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: Passing
- `pnpm lint`: Passing with 2 pre-existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`

### 2026-06-03 - Codex (CRM-BOOKINGS-COMMAND-CENTER-001 - Premium Bookings UI)

**Task:** Redesign the CRM Bookings page into a premium Bookings Command Center without removing existing booking workflow logic.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/bookings/page.tsx` - loads unified command-center booking rows, cash summary, and callback follow-up rows.
- `src/app/api/crm/bookings/route.ts` - returns the same command-center payload and replaces direct console logging with `logError`.
- `src/lib/queries/bookings.ts` - added `getCrmBookingsCommandCenterRows()` to merge today's schedule with the pending/incoming CRM queue.
- `src/components/features/bookings/bookings-workspace.tsx` - rebuilt the page shell with title/subtitle, KPI cards, exact six workflow tabs, tab hints, filters, and callback follow-up placement.
- `src/components/features/bookings/bookings-table.tsx` - rebuilt the list/detail layout with command-center table columns, selected-row styling, right-side Selected Booking panel, compact payment confirmation, and next-best action buttons.
- `src/components/features/bookings/callback-followup-panel.tsx` - restyled callback summary cards to match the command-center surface.
- `src/components/shared/overlays/admin-dialog.tsx` - added dim blurred modal backdrop.

**Behavior:**
- CRM Bookings now opens as `Bookings Command Center` with the requested subtitle and primary `Refresh` / `New Booking` controls.
- Workflow tabs are in-page and count-backed: Needs Confirmation, Confirmed, Waiting / Arrived, In Service, Completed, Callback Follow-up.
- The booking table now shows Customer, Service, Time, Source/Type, Status, Payment, Amount, and Next Action.
- The selected booking rail centralizes booking details, payment status, confirmation hold/payment confirmation, next best action, recommendations, and secondary menus.
- Home-service travel states stay visible in the workflow instead of falling between tabs.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: Passing
- `pnpm lint`: Passing with 2 pre-existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`
- `pnpm build`: Passing, 89 routes
- In-app browser reached `http://localhost:3000/crm/bookings` but redirected to `/login`; authenticated visual click-through still needs a CRM/CSR browser session.

### 2026-06-03 — Claude Code (Service Countdown Timer Chip)

**Task:** Add a compact live service timer to the CRM selected booking right panel.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/bookings/service-countdown-chip.tsx` — new `ServiceCountdownChip` client component.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/bookings/bookings-table.tsx` — imported `ServiceCountdownChip` and inserted it as the first item in the `BookingDetailsPanel` sections container, between the compact hero card and `CrmNextActionsPanel`.

**Implementation:**
- Six timer phases: `buffer` (start buffer), `delayed` (start overdue), `running` (service in progress), `grace` (wrap-up window), `overtime` (past grace), `done` (completed tiny chip).
- Phase logic:
  - `checked_in` + `resourceId` set → 5-minute start buffer counting down from `checkedInAt` (or mount time as fallback).
  - `session_started` / `in_progress` → countdown from `sessionStartedAt + durationMinutes`; transitions to grace then overtime automatically.
  - `completed` → tiny one-line "Completed · Service finished" chip.
  - Pending, cancelled, no_show, home service → returns `null` (no chip rendered).
- Hydration safety: `tick` state is `null` on first render; both `mountMs` and first `nowMs` are set inside a `setTimeout(..., 0)` callback so setState is never called directly in the effect body (avoids `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`). `mountMs` is stored in state (not a ref) to avoid `react-hooks/refs` read-during-render error.
- Progress bar animates with `transition-[width] duration-700 ease-linear` using CSS variable design tokens.
- Icons: `Clock` (buffer), `AlertTriangle` (delayed/overtime), `Timer` (running), `Hourglass` (grace), `CheckCircle2` (done).
- Color scheme: sand/gold for buffer+grace, green for running, soft red for delayed+overtime, neutral for done — all CSS variables only.

**Visual order in right panel:**
```
[compact hero card]
[ServiceCountdownChip — service timer]  ← new
[CrmNextActionsPanel — Next Best Action]
[Booking Details]
[Payment / Confirmation]
```

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 2 pre-existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 89 routes
- Authenticated visual click-through still needs a valid local CRM/CSR browser session.

### 2026-06-03 — Claude Code (Staff Service Progress Workflow)

**Task:** Upgrade the staff portal booking progress system into a full Service Progress workflow with a dedicated modal, direct session start, auto-completion, and CRM revalidation.

**Files Created:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260603000001_staff_direct_session_start.sql` — RPC update allowing `not_started → session_started` for in_spa bookings (direct start without CRM check-in).
- `src/lib/bookings/service-session.ts` — Shared timing helpers: `computeServiceTimerState`, `fmtServiceSecs`, `SERVICE_BUFFER_SECS`, `SERVICE_GRACE_SECS`, `ServiceTimerState`, `ServiceTimerInput`, `ServiceTimerPhase`.
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/service-session-countdown.tsx` — Staff portal live countdown widget (36px bold timer, progress bar, 6 phases: buffer/delayed/running/grace/overtime/done). Fires `onDue` callback when service duration expires.
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/service-progress-modal.tsx` — Bottom sheet with booking header (customer/service/time/room), `ServiceSessionCountdown`, `BookingProgressActions` (full stepper + buttons), and auto-complete orchestration.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/bookings/progress.ts` — Added `session_started` to `IN_SPA_TRANSITIONS.not_started` so staff can go directly to session without CRM check-in.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/staff-portal/actions.ts`:
  - Added `revalidateOperationalBookingSurfaces` import + `revalidateStaffAndOperationalSurfaces` helper (revalidates all staff portal + CRM + manager booking paths).
  - Fixed `updateBookingProgressAction`: now fetches and uses `delivery_type` (not `type`) for TypeScript transition validation, matching RPC behavior.
  - Added `autoCompleteDueSessionAction`: server-validates booking state, checks server-time ≥ service end, calls RPC, revalidates all surfaces.
  - Added `revalidateStaffAndOperationalSurfaces` call after every successful progress update.
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/booking-progress-actions.tsx` — Added optional `onSuccess?: () => void` prop; modal uses it to refresh + close instead of calling `router.refresh()`.
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/staff-appointment-card.tsx` — Converted to `"use client"`. Replaced always-expanded `BookingProgressActions` with compact progress dot + "Service Progress" button that opens `ServiceProgressModal`.

**Key decisions:**
- The `react-hooks/refs` rule in this project forbids reading/writing refs during render. Phase-transition tracking for `onDue` lives in a `useEffect([currentPhase])` — refs are only accessed inside effects.
- `onDue` fires when phase enters `grace` or `overtime` (service duration expired). The `autoCompleteDueSessionAction` independently validates server time, making it safe even if the client clock drifts.
- Home service bookings remain unchanged: travel → arrived → session is still required. The modal shows the full flow for both delivery types.
- CRM still retains full control — the new staff actions go through the same `update_booking_progress` RPC and revalidate all CRM surfaces.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 2 pre-existing warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 89 routes
- Migration `20260603000001_staff_direct_session_start.sql` needs `supabase db push` to reach production.
- Authenticated browser click-through still needs a valid local staff-portal session.

### 2026-06-03 — Claude Code (Hybrid Selected Booking Card)

**Task:** Integrate service countdown directly into the CRM Bookings selected-booking right panel hero card instead of as a separate section below.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/bookings/hybrid-selected-booking-card.tsx` — `HybridSelectedBookingCard` client component.
  - **Normal mode**: hero (avatar + customer + service + room), detail rows (Customer/Service/Staff/Room/Time), and `Start Service` button when booking is checked-in with a room.
  - **Active service mode** (triggered by `status === "in_progress"` OR `booking_progress_status === "session_started"` AND `session_started_at != null`): same hero, plus integrated `CountdownZone` (minutes remaining, MM:SS timer, `of N min` total, segmented progress bar, "Started HH:MM · Staff · Room" meta row), and `Complete Service` button.
  - Uses `TickState | null` pattern (setState from callbacks only — no direct setState in effect body, no refs during render).
  - Exported `HybridBookingViewModel` type for the flat view-model passed from the panel.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/bookings/bookings-table.tsx`:
  - Swapped `ServiceCountdownChip` import for `HybridSelectedBookingCard`.
  - Removed `X` icon import (close button now lives inside `HybridSelectedBookingCard`).
  - `BookingDetailsPanel` gains two `useTransition` hooks (`isStarting`, `isCompleting`) and `useRouter` for direct start/complete service actions.
  - `handleStartService` / `handleCompleteService` helpers call the existing `statusAction` (or `updateBookingStatusAction` fallback), show a Sonner toast, then revalidate.
  - Old hero card block + `ServiceCountdownChip` replaced by `HybridSelectedBookingCard` mapped from the `WorkspaceBookingRow`.
  - `CrmNextActionsPanel` is suppressed when `isServiceActive` to avoid duplicate "Complete Service" buttons; it remains active for all other workflow states (pending confirmation, arrival, dispatch, room assignment, etc.).
  - Panel title row simplified: booking code + status pills shown as a compact header row.

**Behavior:**
- Pending / confirmed / not-started bookings: clean detail card, `Start Service` only when `checked_in + resource assigned` (non-home-service).
- In-progress / session-started bookings: same card but the countdown zone appears, showing live `N min remaining`, `MM:SS` timer, segmented bar, and `Complete Service` button.
- Home-service bookings: countdown and Start/Complete buttons are suppressed; `CrmNextActionsPanel` handles dispatch flow.
- Both CRM and staff portal write to the same `booking_progress_status` / `session_started_at` fields; CRM auto-refreshes after progress updates from either source.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing

### 2026-06-03 — Claude Code (Fix: Service Workflow Bug — Complete Service before session start)

**Task:** Fix the selected booking panel showing "Complete Service" when the service had not actually started.

**Root cause (multi-layered):**
1. `updateBookingStatusAction` only wrote `status = 'in_progress'`. It did NOT call the `update_booking_progress` RPC, so `booking_progress_status = 'session_started'` and `session_started_at` were never set.
2. `isServiceActive` in `BookingDetailsPanel` checked `status === 'in_progress'` without requiring `session_started_at`. So any booking marked `in_progress` via the old path triggered the "active" branch — showing "Complete Service" with no countdown.
3. `canStartService` only matched `checked_in + room` bookings, so confirmed non-checked-in bookings got neither "Start Service" nor "Complete Service" — just blank actions.

**Fix summary:**

`src/app/(dashboard)/crm/bookings/actions.ts`:
- Added `revalidatePath` import + `revalidateServiceSurfaces()` (covers CRM + manager + all staff-portal paths).
- Added `crmStartServiceAction({ bookingId })`: validates CRM access, calls `update_booking_progress` RPC with `session_started` (atomically sets `session_started_at`, `booking_progress_status`, and `status = 'in_progress'`). Idempotent for already-started bookings.
- Added `crmCompleteServiceAction({ bookingId })`: calls RPC with `completed` (atomically sets `session_completed_at`, `booking_progress_status = 'completed'`, `status = 'completed'`). Idempotent for already-completed bookings.

`src/components/features/bookings/hybrid-selected-booking-card.tsx`:
- Added `useRef` import.
- Added `onAutoComplete?: () => void` prop.
- Tightened `isServiceActive`: now requires BOTH `(status === 'in_progress' || progress === 'session_started')` AND `Boolean(session_started_at)`.
- Moved elapsed/remaining/progressPct computation to top level so the auto-complete effect can read them.
- Added `hasAutoCompletedRef` + `useEffect([isCountdownDue, onAutoComplete])` that fires `onAutoComplete` exactly once when countdown hits zero. Refs read/written in effect (never during render) — satisfies `react-hooks/refs` rule.

`src/components/features/bookings/bookings-table.tsx`:
- Imported `crmStartServiceAction`, `crmCompleteServiceAction`, `autoCompleteDueSessionAction`, `isBookingClosedForCrm`.
- Fixed `isServiceActive`: same tight guard (requires `session_started_at`).
- Broadened `canStartService`: any confirmed in-spa non-closed non-pending booking, not just checked_in+room.
- Changed `handleStartService` → `crmStartServiceAction` (RPC-based).
- Changed `handleCompleteService` → `crmCompleteServiceAction` (RPC-based).
- Added `handleAutoComplete` → `autoCompleteDueSessionAction` (server-validated).
- Added `wrappedStatusAction`: intercepts `status = 'in_progress'` in `CrmNextActionsPanel`'s "Start Service" call and routes it through `crmStartServiceAction` so that path also uses the RPC correctly.
- Passed `onAutoComplete={isServiceActive ? handleAutoComplete : undefined}` to `HybridSelectedBookingCard`.
- Added `key={booking.id + session_started_at}` to `HybridSelectedBookingCard` so `hasAutoCompletedRef` resets when a new session starts.

**Verification:**

- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 2 pre-existing warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 89 routes

### 2026-06-03 — Claude Code (Fix: Start Service countdown not appearing)

**Task:** Fix Start Service showing a success toast but countdown not activating.

**Root causes (all three fixed):**

1. **RPC migration not applied**: `crmStartServiceAction` called `update_booking_progress` RPC with `session_started`, but the `not_started → session_started` transition was only enabled by migration `20260603000001_staff_direct_session_start.sql` which had never been pushed. Both `crmStartServiceAction` and `crmCompleteServiceAction` now use **direct `supabase.update()`** (writing `status`, `booking_progress_status`, and `session_started_at`/`session_completed_at` in one statement) — no RPC dependency.
   - Also fixed: idempotency check now requires `session_started_at` to be non-null so limbo bookings (status=in_progress, no timestamp) are not silently skipped.

2. **Cross-tab booking disappearance**: After `router.refresh()`, the booking moved from "confirmed" tab to "in-service" tab. `BookingsTable.selected` derived from the current tab's `pageBookings`, so the booking was no longer found and the panel showed a different booking (or went blank).
   - **Fix**: `BookingsWorkspace` now passes `allBookings={bookings}` to `BookingsTable`. `BookingsTable.selected` falls back to `allBookings` when `selectedId` is not in the current tab — the right panel stays on the correct booking across tab transitions.

3. **No optimistic state during refresh window**: Between action success and refresh completing (~500ms), `booking.session_started_at` was still null, so the countdown could not appear.
   - **Fix**: `BookingDetailsPanel` has a `sessionOverride` state that is set in the Start Service success callback with `{ status, booking_progress_status, session_started_at }`. `effectiveStatus/ProgressStatus/SessionStartedAt` merge server props with the override. `HybridSelectedBookingCard` uses these effective values — countdown activates immediately. When the parent's `key` changes (server data arrives), the panel remounts and clears the override.

**Files changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/bookings/actions.ts` — direct update in `crmStartServiceAction` + `crmCompleteServiceAction`; tighter idempotency check
- `src/components/features/bookings/bookings-workspace.tsx` — pass `allBookings={bookings}` to `BookingsTable`
- `src/components/features/bookings/bookings-table.tsx` — `allBookings` fallback in `selected` derivation; `key` on `BookingDetailsPanel`; `SessionOverride` state + effective fields in `BookingDetailsPanel`; `wrappedStatusAction` also sets override

### 2026-06-03 - Codex (CRM-SCHEDULE-FULL-CALENDAR-001 - Staff Full Schedule Modal)

**Task:** Build a responsive Staff Full Schedule Calendar Modal for the CRM Schedule selected-staff right panel.

**Files Created:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/schedule/actions.ts` - server action that loads selected staff schedule data, overrides, group fallback rules, blocked times, and bookings with branch-scoped access checks.
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/staff-schedule-calendar-modal.tsx` - client modal with Day, Week, and Month calendar views.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/schedule/crm-schedule-details-panel.tsx` - replaced the old `View Full Schedule` navigation link with a modal-opening action and passes selected staff context into the modal.
- `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-workspace.tsx` - passes the selected availability item and branch name into the details panel.

**Behavior:**
- `View Full Schedule` now opens an in-page modal instead of navigating away.
- Week view is the default, uses Monday-Sunday columns, and renders a time rail with shift, day-off, booking, blocked-time, and overnight blocks.
- Day view focuses the selected date, while Month view shows a compact operational overview across the full grid.
- The modal prefers individual staff schedules and falls back to staff-group rules when individual active schedules are not present.
- Summary cards, date navigation, filters, and legend are included in the modal shell.

## 2026-06-03 — Therapist Staff Portal Mobile UI

**Task:** Implement approved Therapist Staff Portal mobile experience for service provider staff (therapist, nail_tech, aesthetician, salon_head).

**New server action:**
- `getMyServiceProgressAction(date)` in `actions.ts` — fetches all non-cancelled today's bookings; returns `{ active, completed, staff }`.

**New route:** `/staff-portal/service-progress` — therapist service progress page.

**New components (13) in `src/components/features/staff-portal/therapist/`:**
- `therapist-mobile-bottom-nav.tsx` — Home, Schedule, Service (→ /service-progress), Stats, More
- `therapist-header.tsx` — header with logo, role label, bell, avatar
- `therapist-greeting-card.tsx` — service-aware status: In Service, Traveling, On Duty, Day Off, No Shift
- `therapist-shift-card.tsx` — My Shift Today (reuses same pattern as basic)

- `page.tsx` (home) — therapist mode → `TherapistMobileHome`; schedule data also fetched for therapist
- `schedule/page.tsx` — therapist mobile → `TherapistScheduleList`
- `week/page.tsx` — therapist mobile → `TherapistWeekDetail`
- `stats/page.tsx` — therapist mobile → `TherapistStats`; desktop keeps existing `BookingStatsDesktop`
- `more/page.tsx` — mode-aware: therapist → `TherapistMoreMenu`, basic → `BasicStaffMoreMenu`

**Key design decisions:**
- `BookingProgressActions` reused unchanged inside service progress cards — no duplicate progress system
- Dispatch page at `/staff-portal/dispatch` unchanged — therapist home and more menu link there
- Basic Staff Portal (`basic/` folder) and Driver Portal completely untouched
- Service-aware status badge in greeting: detects session_started → "In Service", travel_started/arrived → "Traveling"

**Verification:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false`: PASS
- `pnpm lint`: PASS (0 errors, 2 pre-existing warnings in scripts/)
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 93 routes (+1 /staff-portal/service-progress)

## 2026-06-03 — Driver Staff Portal Mobile UI

**Task:** Implement approved Driver Staff Portal mobile experience for driver staff (system_role=driver OR staff_type=driver).

**New server actions (4) in actions.ts:**
- `getMyDriverJobsAction(date)` — today's dispatch jobs via `getDispatchData(role="driver")`
- `getMyDriverAllJobsAction()` — last 30 days of jobs for "All" tab (direct driver_id query)
- `getMyDriverJobByIdAction(bookingId)` — single job with driver safety check
- `getMyDriverStatsAction(year, month)` — monthly stats queried by driver_id

**New routes (4):** /staff-portal/map, /staff-portal/jobs, /staff-portal/jobs/active, /staff-portal/jobs/[bookingId]

**New components (18) in src/components/features/staff-portal/driver/:**
- driver-mobile-bottom-nav.tsx — Home, Dispatch, Map, Jobs, More
- driver-header.tsx, driver-greeting-card.tsx (route-aware status), driver-today-overview-card.tsx
- driver-next-stop-card.tsx (countdown badge + address), driver-quick-actions.tsx
- driver-mobile-home.tsx — assembles home
- driver-dispatch-card.tsx, driver-dispatch-page.tsx (Upcoming/History tabs)
- driver-route-map-page.tsx — stop list + Google Maps navigation links (no new map library)
- driver-job-status-stepper.tsx, driver-job-details-page.tsx (Start Travel/Mark Arrived via existing action)
- driver-job-timeline.tsx, driver-active-job-page.tsx (reuses TrackingTimer)
- driver-job-card.tsx, driver-jobs-list-page.tsx (Today/All + summary strip)
- driver-stats-page.tsx (by driver_id), driver-more-menu.tsx

**Modified pages:** home, dispatch, stats, more — all now route driver mode to driver components.

**Key decisions:**
- `updateBookingProgressAction` reused for travel/arrived transitions — no duplicate progress system
- `getDispatchData(role="driver")` reused — no new dispatch table
- Map uses Google Maps links — no new map library installed
- Basic Staff Portal and Therapist Portal completely untouched

**Verification:** tsc PASS, lint PASS (0 errors, 2 pre-existing warnings), build PASS (96 routes), zero TypeScript `any`

## 2026-06-03 — Driver Staff Portal Mobile Shell + Safe Profile Refinement

**Task:** Refine the driver staff mobile portal so navigation/profile editing match the approved mobile-first flow and staff identity edits stay safe.

**New/updated driver components:**
- `driver-mobile-shell.tsx` — shared mobile shell for driver staff; owns persistent bottom nav and profile sheet.
- `driver-mobile-bottom-nav.tsx` — bottom nav is now Home, Dispatch, Map, Jobs, Profile; Profile opens the sheet instead of routing to a separate More tab.
- `driver-profile-sheet.tsx` — mobile bottom sheet reusing safe profile/photo actions; staff can edit only full name, nickname, and avatar.
- `driver-schedule-page.tsx` — mobile driver schedule grouped by week days and assigned trips.
- `driver-route-bottom-card.tsx`, `driver-status-badge.tsx`, `driver-empty-state.tsx` — shared route/status/empty-state UI helpers.

**Modified behavior:**
- `/staff-portal/layout.tsx` wraps only driver-mode staff in `DriverMobileShell`, preserving existing Basic and Therapist mobile portals.
- Driver screens no longer render duplicated fixed bottom navs.
- `/staff-portal/schedule` now renders `DriverSchedulePage` on mobile for driver staff and keeps the desktop schedule on desktop.
- `updateBookingProgressAction` now treats `staff_type="driver"` as driver authority for assigned travel/arrival transitions, not only `system_role="driver"`.
- Staff profile lookup now includes branch relation data for read-only profile context.
- Staff/booking revalidation includes driver routes (`dispatch`, `map`, `jobs`, `jobs/active`, `stats`, `more`) and operational CRM dispatch/live surfaces.

**Safety notes:**
- Staff Portal profile details action remains restricted to `full_name` and `nickname`.
- System role, staff role/type, tier, branch, active status, permissions, services, schedules, and assignments are read-only or unavailable to staff self-edit flows.
- Profile photo update continues through the existing `updateStaffProfilePhotoAction`.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS
- `pnpm lint`: PASS (0 errors, 2 pre-existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`)
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 96 routes
- Local unauthenticated route smoke checks for `/staff-portal`, `/dispatch`, `/map`, `/jobs`, `/jobs/active`, `/schedule`, `/stats`, `/more`, `/profile` returned 307 -> `/login` as expected.

- `src/components/features/mobile-shell/floating-mobile-bottom-nav.tsx` - nav items support explicit aria labels.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/staff-portal/actions.ts` - self-profile update now optionally accepts and updates phone while preserving full-name/nickname-only behavior for forms that do not submit phone.
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/types.ts` - Staff portal staff type includes phone and active status.
- `src/lib/dev-bypass.ts` - dev bypass staff record includes profile fields required by the driver modal.

**Behavior:**

- View mode shows real staff data: avatar/initials, full name, nickname, Driver role, branch, duty chip, phone, staff type, Driver Portal access, readiness, actions, and logout.
- Edit mode stays inside the sheet and supports full name, nickname, phone, and profile photo.
- Save shows an inline spinner, refreshes profile data, and returns to view mode on success.
- Unsupported/admin fields remain unavailable to driver self-edit: system role, staff type, tier, branch, active status, service assignments, schedule rules, and permissions.
- Standalone `/driver/*` contexts keep missing action routes disabled instead of linking to broken routes.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS
- `pnpm lint`: PASS (0 errors, 2 existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`)
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 98 routes

**Behavior:**
- Mobile driver Route Map now shows a compact header, real route status summary chips, map-like route panel, floating map controls, next-stop bottom sheet, navigation/details actions, and today stops strip.
- Visible route UI uses Route Map / Map / Trips wording; internal dispatch route/query names remain unchanged for safety.
- ETA and distance only show concrete values when the existing dispatch item data supports them; otherwise the UI uses pending labels instead of fake values.
- The persistent floating bottom nav remains owned by `DriverMobileShell`; the Route Map page does not render its own bottom nav.
- No backend logic, booking status rules, tables, or desktop dispatch workspace were changed.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS
- `pnpm lint`: PASS (0 errors, 2 existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`)
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 97 routes
- `git diff --check`: PASS with LF/CRLF warnings only
- Protected route smoke checks for `/staff-portal/map`, `/driver/map`, and `/driver/dispatch` reached the local server and redirected unauthenticated traffic to `/login` as expected.

**Follow-up:**
- Authenticated mobile visual QA still needs a valid local driver staff session because this turn only had unauthenticated route access and no in-app browser screenshot tool.

- Basic, Therapist, legacy Staff mobile home, and standalone Driver mobile pages - removed duplicate per-page fixed nav renders and old hardcoded `paddingBottom: 96`.

**Behavior:**
- Mobile staff, therapist, and driver workspaces now get one persistent shell-owned floating glass bottom nav.
- Desktop behavior remains unchanged through `md:hidden` nav and `md:contents` shell behavior.
- Staff portal mobile routes preserve existing Basic, Therapist, Driver, mobile week, and mobile schedule component flows.
- Standalone `/driver` and `/driver/dispatch` now share the same mobile driver shell/profile sheet pattern as driver staff portal routes.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS
- `pnpm lint`: PASS (0 errors, 2 existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`)
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 96 routes
- Protected route smoke checks for `/staff-portal`, `/staff-portal/schedule`, `/staff-portal/service-progress`, `/staff-portal/dispatch`, `/driver`, and `/driver/dispatch` reached the local server and redirected unauthenticated traffic to `/login` as expected.

**Follow-up:**
- Authenticated mobile visual QA still needs a valid local staff/therapist/driver session because the current unauthenticated route checks redirect to `/login`.

- `src/components/features/staff-portal/driver/driver-dispatch-page.tsx` - compatibility wrapper now delegates to `DriverTripsPage` so old visible Dispatch copy is not used.

**Behavior:**
- Driver mobile Trips page shows Today, Upcoming, and History filters.
- Active in-progress trips are promoted into a premium active trip section.
- Upcoming trips and completed/cancelled history use real booking/trip data from existing driver dispatch queries/actions.
- No backend logic, status rules, tables, or desktop dispatch workspace were changed.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS
- `pnpm lint`: PASS (0 errors, 2 existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`)

- `src/components/features/staff-portal/driver/driver-mobile-shell.tsx` - mounts one mobile progress provider/line around driver children, nav, and profile sheet.
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/mobile/staff-mobile-shell.tsx` - mounts one mobile progress provider/line for Basic Staff navigation.
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/therapist/therapist-mobile-shell.tsx` - mounts one mobile progress provider/line for Therapist navigation.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/driver/page.tsx` - removed an existing inline-styled desktop error banner in favor of Tailwind classes.

**Behavior:**
- Mobile bottom-nav route taps show a thin forest/teal top loading line.
- Tapping the current active route does not start progress.
- Driver Profile remains a modal button action and does not start route progress.
- Existing route-level skeleton loading remains intact, with child-route skeletons added for standalone driver Trips, Jobs, and Map.
- Desktop UI remains unchanged.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS
- `pnpm lint`: PASS (0 errors, 2 existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`)

**Follow-up:**
- Authenticated mobile visual QA still needs valid local Basic Staff, Therapist, and Driver sessions because protected mobile routes redirect unauthenticated traffic to `/login` and no in-app browser navigation/screenshot tool was exposed in this turn.

- Existing `upsertStaffGroupScheduleRuleAction`, `deleteStaffGroupScheduleRuleAction`, and `saveStaffWeeklyScheduleAction` remain the only write paths.
- Booking, dispatch, driver portal, payment, schema, and unrelated operational logic were not changed.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS
- `pnpm lint`: PASS (0 errors, 2 existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`)
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 98 routes
- `git diff --check`: PASS with LF/CRLF warnings only
- Protected route smoke checks for `/crm/staff-availability`, `/crm/staff-availability?tab=individual`, `/crm/staff-availability?tab=coverage`, and `/manager/staff-availability` redirected unauthenticated traffic to `/login` as expected.
- Targeted scan found no inline styles, `any`, `@ts-ignore`, or lingering `React.ComponentType` references in touched schedule files.

**Follow-up:**
- Authenticated visual QA still needs a valid CRM/manager session because protected schedule setup routes redirect unauthenticated traffic to `/login` and no in-app browser navigation/screenshot tool was exposed in this turn.

## 2026-06-05 - Codex (PUBLIC-MOBILE-HOME-REVEAL-FIX-001 - Mobile Loading and Hero Overlay Refinement)

**Task:** Fix the public mobile homepage so the old generic loading skeleton no longer appears before the Cradle reveal, the first hero image is ready when the reveal ends, and the hero photo is not washed out by a heavy overlay.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/loading.tsx` - replaced the root gray skeleton fallback with a lightweight branded Cradle loading bridge using deep forest green, cream, and warm gold.
- `src/components/public/mobile/cradle-breath-reveal.tsx` - changed reveal state from immediate visible/default-dismissed behavior to an explicit checking/showing/hidden state so repeat sessions do not flash the reveal overlay.
- `src/components/public/mobile/mobile-home-hero-carousel.tsx` - changed the first hero image to Next 16 `preload={true}` behavior, left secondary slides unpreloaded, and replaced the heavy full-screen overlay with targeted top/text/bottom gradients plus a subtle warm glow.
- `.context/CURRENT_TASK.cmd.md`, `.context/HANDOFF.cmd.md`, `.context/CHANGELOG.cmd.md` - updated Codex task records.

**Behavior:**
- Public route streaming now starts with Cradle-branded loading instead of generic skeleton blocks.
- `hero-mobile.jpg` is the only preloaded mobile hero slide; `hero-wide.jpg` and `hero-ambience.jpg` remain normal secondary carousel images.
- Overlay moved from one full-screen green wash (`0.38 -> 0.66 -> 0.96`) to localized layers: top `0.42 -> 0.18 -> 0`, bottom max `0.78`, text-area `0.44 -> 0.16 -> 0`, and warm glow max `0.16`.
- The hero image remains visible behind the copy with warmer skin tones and less green wash.
- Homepage sections below the hero remain unchanged.
- Booking, Supabase, schema, server actions, CRM/admin/staff/driver portals, authentication, RBAC, and route behavior were not changed.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS
- `pnpm lint`: PASS (0 errors, 2 existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`)
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 98 routes
- Headless Chrome mobile screenshot at 390x844 captured the branded reveal state on `http://localhost:3000`.
- Headless Chrome mobile screenshot at 390x844 captured the post-reveal hero with the photo visible and no gray skeleton shell.
- Rendered stream check confirmed the new `Loading Cradle Wellness Living` fallback markup is emitted.

**Follow-up:**
- The Browser plugin navigation/screenshot tool was not exposed in this turn, so screenshots were captured with local headless Chrome instead.

## 2026-06-05 - Codex (PUBLIC-MOBILE-HOME-DARK-SECTIONS-001 - Dark Cinematic Mobile Homepage Sections)

**Task:** Refine the public mobile homepage sections after the hero so they match the approved dark, premium, cinematic spa mockup.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/public/mobile/public-mobile-home.tsx` - removed the lighter interim mobile sections from the homepage flow and converted FAQ shell to dark glass.
- `src/components/public/mobile/mobile-calm-categories.tsx` - rebuilt service category cards as full-image dark cinematic cards.
- `src/components/public/mobile/mobile-most-loved-treatments.tsx` - rebuilt most-loved treatment cards as image-dominant dark cards with compact booking actions.
- `src/components/public/mobile/mobile-signature-rituals.tsx` - rebuilt ritual cards as immersive full-image panels with bottom dark glass content.
- `src/components/public/mobile/mobile-guest-impressions.tsx` - converted testimonials to dark translucent glass cards with gold stars and dots.
- `src/components/public/mobile/mobile-branches-section.tsx` - converted branch cards to image-led location cards with dark glass details and actions.
- `src/components/public/mobile/mobile-final-cta.tsx` - tightened final CTA copy and action to the requested cinematic Book Now treatment.
- `src/components/public/faq-accordion.tsx` - added a dark variant while preserving the default light presentation.
- `src/components/public/home-page-sections.tsx` - adjusted desktop homepage hero image `sizes` to account for the hidden mobile tree and address the `/images/spa/hero.jpg` warning.
- `.context/CURRENT_TASK.cmd.md`, `.context/HANDOFF.cmd.md`, `.context/CHANGELOG.cmd.md`, `.context/ERRORS.cmd.md` - updated Codex task records.

**Behavior:**
- Mobile homepage flow is now hero/reveal, Service Categories, Most-Loved Treatments, Signature Rituals, Guest Impressions, Branches, FAQ, and Final CTA.
- Mobile homepage sections no longer use white/cream card surfaces in the touched section files.
- Existing services and branches data continue to drive cards; no fake data, generated images, or stock images were added.
- Booking links still point to the existing `/book` route and service/category links still use existing `/services` anchors.
- Booking logic, Supabase/database logic, server actions, CRM/admin/staff/driver portals, authentication, RBAC, and route behavior were not changed.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS
- `pnpm lint`: PASS (0 errors, 2 existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`)
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 98 routes
- `git diff --check`: PASS with LF/CRLF notices only
- Localhost smoke check returned HTTP 200 and rendered the new mobile section headings.
- Targeted source scan found no `bg-white`, `bg-[#F3E9D2]`, `bg-[#FFF8E9]`, or `#FFFFFF` card backgrounds in the touched mobile homepage section files.

**Follow-up:**
- Headless Chrome screenshot capture was blocked because sandboxed Chrome failed with access denied and the escalated browser run was declined. Manual/in-app visual QA can still be run in a normal browser session.

## 2026-06-06 - Codex (PUBLIC-MOBILE-LOADING-TRANSITIONS-001 - Public Mobile Intro and Route Loading)

**Task:** Implement the final public mobile loading/transition behavior: one short homepage intro on first `/` entry per browser session, plus a simple top route-loading line for public page navigation.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/public/public-loading-events.ts` - typed intro active-state event name/detail shared by the intro and route line.
- `src/components/public/public-route-loading-line.tsx` - root-mounted, public-route-scoped client route-loading line.
- `src/app/(public)/loading.tsx` - public segment warm-gold top-line loading fallback.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/public/mobile/cradle-breath-reveal.tsx` - switched to `cradle_public_intro_seen`, shortened to 1.2 seconds, and emits intro active/inactive events.
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - mounts the self-scoped public route loading line.
- `src/app/loading.tsx` - replaced the full-screen branded loading bridge with a non-branded dark mobile paint guard so no second shell appears before the homepage intro and mobile avoids light/white flash.
- `src/app/globals.css` - added public route line keyframes/classes and shortened intro animation timing.
- `.context/CURRENT_TASK.cmd.md`, `.context/HANDOFF.cmd.md`, `.context/CHANGELOG.cmd.md`, `.context/ERRORS.cmd.md`, `.context/DECISIONS.cmd.md` - updated task records.
- `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md` - logged the public loading transition update.

**Behavior:**
- Mobile homepage intro appears only from the homepage component and only once per browser session via `cradle_public_intro_seen`.
- Desktop, reduced-motion, and repeat-session visits skip the intro without a flash.
- Public top-line loading starts only for normal internal clicks between `/`, `/services`, `/book`, `/branches`, `/about`, and `/contact`.
- The line ignores hash links, `tel:`, `mailto:`, external links, modified clicks, same-route links, and booking subroutes/step paths.
- Intro-active events suppress route-line starts while the intro is playing; the line also sits below the intro overlay and above the public header.
- Root route streaming no longer emits the old full-screen `Loading Cradle Wellness Living` bridge; it only paints a non-branded dark mobile background while content streams.
- Booking logic, booking data, APIs, Supabase/database logic, server actions, protected workspaces, CRM/admin/staff/driver portals, auth/RBAC, and middleware were not changed.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS
- `pnpm lint`: PASS (0 errors, 2 existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`)
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 98 routes
- `git diff --check`: PASS with LF/CRLF notices only
- Local public route smoke checks: `/`, `/services`, `/book`, `/branches`, `/about`, and `/contact` all returned HTTP 200 on `http://localhost:3000`.
- Rendered public HTML checks found no old `Loading Cradle Wellness Living` shell text.
- Targeted source scan found no new `any`, `@ts-ignore`, console logs, old intro key, or old full-screen loading-shell markers in touched loading/intro files.

**Follow-up:**
- Manual mobile visual QA should verify first homepage session intro, repeat-session skip, `/` back-navigation skip, route line on top-level public navigation, and no line during booking wizard step changes. Tool discovery did not expose the in-app browser controller in this turn.

---

## 2026-06-06 - Codex (PUBLIC-BOOKING-MOBILE-VIEWPORT-001 - Public Booking Mobile Viewport Wizard)

**Task:** Refine the public `/book` mobile booking wizard into a viewport-fitted app-like flow, with mobile Date & Time slots in a bottom sheet instead of below the calendar.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/public/booking-wizard.tsx` - changed the public mobile wizard shell to `h-[100dvh] min-h-[100dvh] overflow-hidden`, added the internal active-step scroll pane, compacted mobile header/progress/short steps, and added the mobile time-slot bottom sheet.
- `src/components/public/booking-service-picker.tsx` - made the service picker live safely inside constrained-height parents, with mobile category chips fixed above an internally scrollable service grid.
- `src/components/public/site-footer.tsx` - added a `public-site-footer` hook class.
- `src/app/globals.css` - added mobile-only `:has(.public-booking-surface)` containment so `/book` does not keep the public footer below the viewport on mobile.
- `.context/CURRENT_TASK.cmd.md`, `.context/HANDOFF.cmd.md`, `.context/CHANGELOG.cmd.md`, `.context/ERRORS.cmd.md` - updated Codex task records.
- `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md` - logged the public booking mobile viewport update.

**Behavior:**
- Public mobile `/book` now uses a viewport-fitted shell with compact booking header/progress, an internally scrollable active-step middle pane, and a fixed bottom action bar.
- Branch, Visit Type, Location, Date & Time, Therapist, Details, and Success steps now use tighter mobile spacing; naturally long content remains inside the middle scroll region.
- Services now keep category chips and selected summary compact while the service grid scrolls internally inside the active step area.
- Date selection on mobile opens a warm dark bottom sheet with available slots, loading/empty/service-required states, dialog semantics, Escape close, focus handoff, safe-area padding, and warm Cradle styling.
- Selecting a time still calls the existing `onSelectSlot` path, updates the existing `selectedSlot` state, resets therapist selection as before, and closes the mobile sheet.
- Desktop Date & Time keeps the existing calendar/time-grid layout.
- Booking step order, branch/service/visit/date/slot/therapist logic, submit payloads, available-slot API behavior, server actions, Supabase/database logic, protected workspaces, CRM/admin/staff/driver portals, auth/RBAC, and public route behavior were not changed.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS
- `pnpm lint`: PASS (0 errors, 2 existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`)
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 98 routes
- `git diff --check`: PASS with LF/CRLF notices only
- `/book` smoke check returned HTTP 200 on `http://localhost:3000`.
- Headless Chrome mobile screenshots captured at 390x844:
  - `.tmp/book-mobile.png` for initial booking shell/loading state
  - `.tmp/book-mobile-loaded.png` for loaded Branch step with fixed bottom action bar
- Targeted scan found no new TypeScript `any`, `@ts-ignore`, or console logs in touched booking files; plain-English "any" matches were copy only.

**Follow-up:**
- Manual mobile click-through should still verify the live Date & Time bottom sheet after selecting branch, visit type, service, and date, because the in-app browser controller was not exposed and full slot availability depends on local/remote API responsiveness.

---

## 2026-06-07 - Codex (PUBLIC-MOBILE-HOME-WARM-RITUALS-001 - Warm Mobile Hero and Signature Ritual Cards)

**Task:** Warmed the public mobile homepage hero and redesigned only the mobile Signature Ritual cards to match the cinematic warm/dark CTA-card style.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/public/mobile/mobile-home-hero-carousel.tsx` - added a subtle amber image veil, warmer layered hero gradients, a warmer gold primary CTA, a warmer dark secondary CTA, and no-wrap guards for the unchanged hero button labels.
- `src/components/public/mobile/mobile-signature-rituals.tsx` - replaced the large dark glass content block with full-background image cards, side-specific darker gradients behind text, lighter subject areas, top-left label pills, nearby price chips, preserved title/copy/duration content, and gold `Book Ritual` pills.
- `.context/CURRENT_TASK.cmd.md`, `.context/HANDOFF.cmd.md`, `.context/CHANGELOG.cmd.md` - updated task records.
- `public/images/spa/home/ritual-glow.jpg`, `public/images/spa/home/ritual-recovery.jpg`, `public/images/spa/home/ritual-full-reset.jpg` - supporting homepage ritual images referenced by the current mobile card state.

**Preserved:**
- Hero copy, hero layout, carousel image logic, button labels, and button hrefs.
- Ritual names, copy, resolved prices, resolved durations, `/book` links, and final image paths.
- Choose Your Calm, public services/about/contact/branches, booking flow, service logic, backend/API, Supabase/database, server actions, protected portals, auth/RBAC, and CRM/admin/staff/driver areas were not changed for this task.

**Final Ritual Images/Object Positions:**
- Glow Ritual: `/images/spa/home/ritual-glow.jpg`, `object-[center_42%]`
- Recovery Ritual: `/images/spa/home/ritual-recovery.jpg`, `object-[center_35%]`
- Full Reset Ritual: `/images/spa/home/ritual-full-reset.jpg`, `object-[center_55%]`

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS
- `pnpm lint`: PASS (0 errors, 2 existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`)
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 98 routes
- `git diff --check`: PASS with LF/CRLF notices only
- `/` returned HTTP 200 on `http://localhost:3000`.
- Mobile browser visual check at 390x844: hero is warmer/readable; Signature Ritual images remain visible; the large dark glass content panel is removed; `Book Ritual` links resolve to `/book`.
- Desktop homepage browser smoke check at 1280x900: PASS, desktop hero/nav/CTA rendered intact.

## 2026-06-07 - Codex (PUBLIC-PAGES-DARK-THEME-001 - Public Pages Dark Theme)

**Task:** Restyled `/services`, `/contact`, `/about`, `/branches`, the shared public service catalog, and the shared public header onto the dark warm Cradle theme. The full detailed entry for this task was also recorded near the top of this append-only changelog during the same update.

**Verification:** `pnpm type-check` PASS; `pnpm lint` PASS with 2 existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`; `pnpm build` PASS, 98 routes; production route checks on temporary `http://localhost:3011` returned HTTP 200 for `/services`, `/contact`, `/about`, and `/branches`; final headless Chrome screenshots were captured under `.tmp/public-dark-screens-prod/`.

---

### 2026-06-11 — Codex

**Task:** Added mobile-only first-visit preloader for Cradle public pages.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/shared/mobile-first-visit-preloader.tsx` — added isolated mobile first-visit preloader
- `src/app/page.tsx` — mounted preloader only on the public homepage
- `src/app/(public)/layout.tsx` — mounted preloader only on public route-group pages
- `src/components/public/mobile/public-mobile-home.tsx` — removed the older homepage-only breath reveal mount so the new preloader is the only public first-visit splash

**Roadmap Items Completed:** Phase 5 mobile polish/loading state coverage partial.

**Notes:** Preloader is mobile-only, session-only, and public-site-only. It does not affect CRM, staff portal, driver portal, owner/admin pages, route navigation, workspace switching, or skeleton loaders. No route progress bar, global loading file, workspace loader, skeleton loader, or global animation system was changed.

**Build Status:** ✅ Passing

---

### 2026-06-11 — Codex (UI-MOBILE-PRELOAD-002)

**Task:** Fixed the mobile preloader so first-visit public pages render the overlay in the initial server HTML before landing-page animations can paint.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/shared/mobile-first-visit-preloader.tsx` — changed the preloader to accept `initiallyVisible`, start visible from server-provided state, use a session cookie plus sessionStorage fallback, apply the dark forest/gold/ivory visual treatment, and add a scoped animation pause guard while mounted.
- `src/lib/public/mobile-preloader.ts` — added shared cookie/storage key constants.
- `src/app/page.tsx` — reads the session cookie with `await cookies()` and passes `initiallyVisible` for `/`.
- `src/app/(public)/layout.tsx` — reads the session cookie with `await cookies()` and passes `initiallyVisible` for public route-group pages.

**Behavior:**
- No-cookie public responses for `/` and public route-group pages include the preloader markup immediately; requests with `cradle_mobile_preloader_seen=1` omit it.
- Mobile clients set `cradle_mobile_preloader_seen=1` as a session cookie and in `sessionStorage`, then fade/remove the overlay after the short timing window.
- Desktop clients remove the server-rendered mobile-hidden overlay without setting the cookie.
- Protected routes do not mount or mark the preloader.
- Route progress bars, workspace loaders, skeleton loaders, global loading files, protected portals, booking logic, Supabase/database logic, APIs, server actions, auth/RBAC, middleware, and global CSS were not changed.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS
- `pnpm lint`: PASS (0 errors, 2 existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`)
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 98 routes
- `git diff --check`: PASS with LF/CRLF notices only
- Raw HTML checks on `http://localhost:3000`: `/` and `/services` include the overlay without the cookie and omit it with the cookie; `/crm` never includes it.
- Headless Chrome mobile CDP check: overlay present at DOMContentLoaded on first `/` visit, session cookie/storage set to `1`, overlay removed after fade, repeat-cookie visit hidden, desktop no-cookie visit hidden with no cookie, protected `/crm` redirected to `/login` with no overlay/cookie.

---

### 2026-06-11 — Codex (CRM-SCHEDULE-UI-001)

**Task:** Fixed CRM Schedule Daily Timeline to fit its display area with expand mode.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-workspace.tsx` — updated the CRM Schedule board layout to use `minmax(0, 1fr)` containment, keep the right rail visible in Fit Day mode, and hide it in Expanded mode.
- `src/components/features/schedule/daily-schedule-board.tsx` — added Fit Day / Expanded behavior, full-width fit containment, expanded horizontal scrolling, sticky header/staff sizing, and shared timeline range props.
- `src/lib/utils/schedule-timeline.ts` — added computed active-day ranges, fit/expanded timeline sizing constants, percent-based block positioning helpers, half-hour range support, and the 8 AM to 11 PM fallback.
- `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-time-header.tsx`, `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-staff-row.tsx`, `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-booking-block.tsx`, `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-blocked-time-block.tsx`, `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-current-time-indicator.tsx`, `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-staff-cell.tsx`, `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-staff-group.tsx`, `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-board-panel.tsx` — threaded timeline mode/range through the shared Daily Timeline rendering path so labels, off-duty regions, bookings, blocked time, and the current-time marker align to the same full-day scale.

**Roadmap Items Completed:** CRM schedule UI polish / Phase 5 responsive workspace polish partial.

**Notes:** Daily Timeline now fits the full active day inside its available center column by default. Expanded mode gives detailed horizontal inspection and collapses the CRM right rail. No booking logic, database logic, Supabase schema, mobile preloader, public landing page, workspace loaders, or skeleton loaders were changed.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS
- `pnpm lint`: PASS (0 errors, 2 existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`)
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 98 routes
- `git diff --check`: PASS with LF/CRLF notices only
- Local route probe: `http://localhost:3000/crm/schedule` returned `307 /login`, confirming protected route reachability but limiting unauthenticated visual QA.

**Build Status:** ✅ Passing

### 2026-06-17 — Codex (AUTH-STAFF-RECOVERY-001)

**Task:** Add secure staff password recovery, accessible password visibility controls, and Owner account-access diagnostics without replacing existing Supabase Auth, RBAC, proxy protection, or workspace switching.

**Files Added:**
- `src/app/(auth)/forgot-password/page.tsx` and `actions.ts` - self-service reset request form with generic response copy.
- `src/app/auth/callback/route.ts` - Supabase auth code exchange handler with internal redirect sanitization.
- `src/app/(auth)/reset-password/page.tsx`, `reset-password-form.tsx`, and `actions.ts` - recovery-session password update flow.
- `src/components/shared/password-input.tsx` - accessible show/hide password input.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/staff/account-access-actions.ts` - Owner-only diagnostics and staff recovery server actions.
- `src/components/features/staff/staff-account-access-panel.tsx` - Owner staff preview diagnostics UI.
- `src/lib/auth/auth-redirects.ts` - callback redirect origin/path helpers.
- `src/lib/auth/account-access-events.ts` - audit/rate-limit helpers for account access events.
- `src/lib/auth/staff-account-diagnostics.ts` - pure diagnostic rule builder.
- `supabase/migrations/20260617000001_staff_account_access_events.sql` - append-only audit/rate-limit table.
- `tests/lib/auth/auth-redirects.test.ts`, `tests/lib/auth/staff-account-diagnostics.test.ts`, `tests/components/shared/password-input.test.tsx` - focused coverage.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` - added Forgot Password link and `PasswordInput`.
- `src/app/onboard/[staffId]/onboard-form.tsx` and `src/app/staff-onboarding/onboarding-form.tsx` - added password visibility controls.
- `src/components/features/staff/staff-preview-panel.tsx` - mounted Owner-only account access panel.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/staff/actions.ts` - preserved nickname during direct staff invite creation.
- `src/types/supabase.ts` - added `staff_account_access_events` table typing.
- `.context/*`, `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md` - updated task records.

**Behavior:**
- Staff can request a secure password reset from `/forgot-password`; the app returns generic copy regardless of whether the email exists.
- Supabase recovery links now land on `/auth/callback`, exchange the auth code, and continue to `/reset-password`.
- Reset-password updates the active recovery session password, records the event, and signs the user out for a fresh login.
- Owner staff preview can diagnose whether CRM/front desk login is blocked by inactive staff status, missing/stale auth link, missing/unchecked auth email, no CRM workspace access, or no prior sign-in.
- Owner can send a password reset link for linked staff auth accounts, with audit/rate-limit recording.
- Service-role access remains server-only.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS
- `pnpm lint`: PASS with 4 existing warnings outside this task.
- Focused tests: PASS, 3 files / 9 tests.
- `pnpm test`: PARTIAL, 39 files passed; 2 known unrelated booking progress tests still fail.
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 100 routes.
- Credential/token scan: PASS, no token/password logging matches.
- Client service-role scan: PASS, no client component imports `createAdminClient`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, or `service_role`.

**Build Status:** PASS with known unrelated full-test residuals

### 2026-06-17 — Codex (CRM-INDIVIDUAL-SCHEDULE-LIVE-SYNC-001)

**Task:** Fix individual staff schedule saves so CRM Live Staff immediately shows the confirmed schedule instead of stale/group-fallback data.

**Files Added:**
- `src/lib/schedule/resolve-staff-schedule.ts` — shared effective schedule resolver with override, individual, group, unscheduled, multi-window, weekday, and overnight helpers.
- `src/lib/queries/resolved-staff-schedules.ts` — branch/date loader that feeds the resolver from `staff_schedules`, `schedule_overrides`, and staff group rules.
- `src/lib/schedule/staff-schedule-write.ts` — verified staff schedule upsert conflict target, returned columns, and saved-row confirmation helper.
- `tests/lib/schedule/resolve-staff-schedule.test.ts` — focused resolver priority, day-off, group fallback, multi-shift, weekday, and overnight coverage.
- `tests/lib/schedule/staff-schedule-write.test.ts` — conflict target and returned-row verification coverage.
- `tests/components/crm/availability-staff-shift-cell.test.tsx` — Live Staff multi-shift display coverage.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/staff-availability/actions.ts` — individual schedule save now includes `csr`, verifies staff branch with the session/RLS client for real users, upserts on `staff_id,day_of_week,shift_type`, selects saved rows back, checks row count, revalidates `/crm/schedule`, and returns safe user errors.
- `src/lib/actions/crm-schedule-availability.ts` — CRM schedule modal weekly save now selects saved rows back, checks row count, normalizes branch comparison, logs technical context server-side, and returns safe permission/time/generic errors.
- `src/lib/queries/schedule.ts` — daily schedule rows now use the shared resolver for `work_start`, `work_end`, `schedule_source`, `schedule_is_day_off`, and `schedule_windows`.
- `src/lib/queries/crm-availability.ts` — Live Staff now reads resolved schedule windows from `getDailySchedule` instead of a separate raw active `staff_schedules` query.
- `src/lib/engine/availability.ts` — booking availability post-filter now uses the shared resolver and treats inactive individual rows as individual day off rather than falling through to group rules.
- `src/components/features/crm/availability/crm-availability-client.tsx` — Staff List shift cell now renders every resolved shift window and shows `2 shifts` for multi-window schedules.
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/individual-schedule-editor.tsx` — after confirmed save, shows `Schedule updated successfully.` and refreshes the current route.
- `src/components/features/crm/schedule/edit-availability-modal.tsx` and `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-workspace.tsx` — standardized successful save copy.
- `src/app/api/crm/availability/route.ts` and `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/live-availability-tab.tsx` — removed short-lived availability caching and SWR dedupe that could keep stale Live Staff data after save.

**Behavior:**
- CRM individual weekly schedule saves no longer report success before Supabase returns the saved rows.
- Date-specific day-off overrides win first, then custom date overrides, individual weekly schedules, group fallback, then unscheduled.
- A saved individual day off is treated as individual schedule state and no longer displays the group fallback.
- Live Staff now displays the exact resolved opening/closing/single windows instead of mixing an aggregated daily span with the first raw active shift row.
- Existing group rules are not overwritten by individual staff edits.
- Booking availability keeps using the same effective schedule priority through the post-filter guard.
- No new realtime subscription was added; same-session freshness uses confirmed save, route revalidation/cache invalidation, router refresh, and no-store availability fetches.

**Database/RLS Findings:**
- `staff_schedules` unique key is `staff_schedules_staff_day_shift_unique` on `staff_id, day_of_week, shift_type`.
- `20260521000001_data_api_explicit_grants.sql` grants authenticated SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on `staff_schedules`.
- `20260529000002_crm_csr_schedule_rls.sql` provides branch-scoped SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE policies for `manager`, `assistant_manager`, `store_manager`, `crm`, `csr_head`, `csr_staff`, and `csr`.
- `schedule_overrides` has branch-scoped operational `FOR ALL`.
- No forward RLS migration was added because the fixed save flow uses upsert, not delete; operational `staff_schedules` DELETE remains intentionally not broadened by this task.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS
- `pnpm test`: PASS, 43 files / 493 tests
- `pnpm lint`: PASS, with 4 existing warnings outside this task
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 100 routes
- Swallowed-error scan: only existing notification audio empty catches, no schedule-related matches

**Manual QA Note:**
- Authenticated CRM browser click-through still needs a real CRM-authorized session to confirm the full modal/table flow visually with production-like data.

### 2026-06-17 — Codex (AUTH-RESET-SUPABASE-CONNECTION-001)

**Task:** Connect local and production CradleHub password reset to Supabase Auth URL configuration and the `/reset-password` recovery flow.

**Files Added:**
- `src/app/(auth)/login/login-form.tsx` — client login form split from the server page so query-param success messaging can render cleanly.
- `src/app/(auth)/login/messages.ts` — shared login/reset copy outside the `"use server"` action module.
- `src/lib/auth/password-policy.ts` — shared reset password requirements and validation helper.
- `tests/app/auth/forgot-password-actions.test.ts` — reset-request redirect, production URL, missing URL, and cooldown coverage.
- `tests/app/auth/login-actions.test.ts` and `tests/app/auth/login-form.test.tsx` — reset-guided login error and post-reset success banner coverage.
- `tests/app/auth/reset-password-actions.test.ts` — password policy, mismatch, recovery marker, update, sign-out, and marker cleanup coverage.
- `tests/app/auth/callback-route.test.ts` — recovery callback/session marker, redirect sanitization, and token-hash callback coverage.
- `tests/lib/auth/password-policy.test.ts` — shared password policy coverage.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/auth/auth-redirects.ts` — added `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` helpers, `/reset-password` URL construction, recovery marker cookie name, and production localhost rejection.
- `src/app/(auth)/forgot-password/actions.ts` and `page.tsx` — reset requests now send Supabase to `/reset-password`, keep safe/generic copy, show safe request errors, and preserve audit/rate-limit logging.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/staff/account-access-actions.ts` — Owner-triggered recovery uses the same trusted reset redirect helper.
- `src/app/auth/callback/route.ts` — handles PKCE `code` and recovery `token_hash`, sanitizes `next`, and sets the recovery-session marker for reset links.
- `src/app/(auth)/reset-password/page.tsx`, `reset-password-form.tsx`, and `actions.ts` — route recovery params through the callback, verify recovery marker/user before update, show invalid/checking/success states, apply password policy, sign out after update, and return to login.
- `src/app/(auth)/login/actions.ts` and `page.tsx` — login failure now points users to password reset and `/login?passwordUpdated=true` renders a confirmation banner.
- `tests/lib/auth/auth-redirects.test.ts` and `tests/components/shared/password-input.test.tsx` — expanded URL guard and independent password visibility coverage.
- `.env.example` — documented the production `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` expectation.
- `.gitignore` — ignored local `.next*.log` files.
- `.context/*`, `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, and `docs/ROADMAP.md` — updated task records.

**Behavior:**
- Staff reset emails now use `${NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/reset-password`; development can fall back to `http://localhost:3000`, while production refuses localhost.
- Supabase recovery redirects landing on `/reset-password?code=...` or `/reset-password?token_hash=...&type=recovery` are exchanged through `/auth/callback` before the form renders.
- Password updates require the recovery-session marker and current Supabase user, update the password once through `auth.updateUser({ password })`, delete the marker, sign out, and redirect to `/login?passwordUpdated=true`.
- `/login` exposes the reset affordance as `Forgot password?` beside the Password label and gives reset-guided copy after failed login.
- Production setup must set Supabase Auth Site URL to `https://cradlewellnessliving.com` and include redirect URLs for `http://localhost:3000/reset-password` and `https://cradlewellnessliving.com/reset-password`; replace any placeholder Vercel redirect with the real deployment URL.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS
- `pnpm lint`: PASS, 0 errors and 4 existing warnings
- `pnpm test`: PASS, 49 files / 513 tests
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 100 routes
- Focused auth reset tests: PASS
- `rg -n "your-project\.vercel\.app|localhost:3000/reset-password" src`: PASS, no matches
- `rg -n "SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY|service_role" src`: only existing server-only `src/lib/supabase/admin.ts`
- `rg -n "console\.(log|debug).*password|password.*console\.(log|debug)" src`: PASS, no matches
- `rg -n "localStorage.*password|sessionStorage.*password" src`: PASS, no matches

**Manual QA Note:**
- Click a real local and production Supabase recovery email after dashboard URL configuration is saved to confirm the provider email template lands on `/reset-password`.

### 2026-06-17 - Codex (RLS-GROUP-SCHEDULE-RULES-001)

**Task:** Repair production RLS and server authorization for CRM/front-desk staff group schedule rule saves.

**Files Added:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260617123431_fix_staff_group_schedule_rules_rls.sql` - forward-only explicit branch-aware SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policies and least-privilege Data API grants.
- `tests/lib/actions/staff-schedule-groups.test.ts` - server-action authorization, branch isolation, safe-error, verified-upsert, delete, and revalidation coverage.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/actions/staff-schedule-groups.ts` - authenticated active-staff and target-group authorization before upsert/delete, centralized role checks, safe errors, returned-row confirmation, and Schedule route revalidation.
- `.context/*`, `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, and `docs/ROADMAP.md` - task findings, deployment evidence, verification, and handoff records.

**Root Cause:**
- The production CRM/CSR write policy included `crm`, `csr_head`, and `csr_staff` but omitted the active legacy `csr` role. A same-branch `csr` could read the parent group through staff read policies, then failed the INSERT side of the upsert with PostgreSQL `42501`.

**Production Result:**
- Migration `20260617123431` is applied and recorded on project `lsrbwqhvzjfpiabeolkv`.
- RLS remains enabled. Owner is unrestricted; approved Manager and CRM/front-desk roles are branch-scoped; ordinary staff, driver, utility, cross-branch users, and anonymous clients cannot write.
- Anonymous table grants were removed. Authenticated grants are SELECT-only on schedule groups and SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on group rules, with RLS enforcing row scope.
- Live rollback-only tests passed all 14 authorization cases. Production row counts and schedule/availability RPC results remained unchanged, and no test rows persisted.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS
- `pnpm lint`: PASS, 0 errors and 4 existing warnings
- `pnpm test`: PASS, 50 files / 519 tests
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 100 routes
- `git diff --check`: PASS, line-ending notices only

**Manual QA Note:**
- Authenticated browser save remains pending because no CRM/front-desk credentials or existing authenticated browser session were available. Live RLS verification used real active production auth identities in rollback-only authenticated-role transactions without bypassing RLS.

---

### 2026-06-17 - Codex (CRM-DAILY-TIMELINE-REPLACEMENT-001)

**Task:** Replace only the CRM Schedule module's Daily Timeline tab with the approved role-aware operations board.

**Daily Timeline Replaced:**
- Replaced the old `DailyTimelineTab -> ScheduleWorkspace` composition with a CRM-specific operational board using existing resolved schedules, bookings, blocked periods, overrides, branch context, and realtime route refresh.
- Added staff-type tabs, branch/shift/status/search filters, opening/regular/closing/day-off bands, sticky staff identities, fixed timeline grid, booking and blocked-time overlays, current-time marker, coverage rail, selected staff/booking details, quick actions, available staff, and daily summary.

**Cleanup and Preservation:**
- Removed `daily-timeline-right-rail.tsx` and the unreferenced `crm-schedule-view.tsx`.
- Retained shared `ScheduleWorkspace`, `DailyScheduleBoard`, schedule resolution, timeline utilities, and Owner/Manager schedule pages.
- Preserved `/crm/schedule`, module tab/date URL state, Live Availability, Schedule Setup, Coverage Issues, Staff Schedule, Weekly Rules, Individual Adjustments, Overrides, booking availability, schedule saving, RLS, and CRM authorization.
- Quick actions reuse `/crm/bookings/new`, `/crm/availability`, and `/crm/staff-availability` deep links instead of rebuilding setup forms.

**Error and State Handling:**
- Daily schedule load errors now render inside the Daily tab so other Schedule tabs stay usable.
- Staff-type selection persists in `?staffType=` through module tab switches; date and active module tab continue using existing URL conventions.
- Live availability status uses a server-seeded, minute-updated client clock to avoid hydration drift.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS
- `pnpm lint`: PASS, 0 errors and 4 existing warnings
- `pnpm test`: PASS, 51 files / 525 tests
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 100 routes
- Responsive component-tree browser QA at 1440x1000 and 390x844: PASS, no page overflow, error overlay, or console errors
- Daily -> Live Availability -> Daily switching, staff-type persistence, search/clear filters, and booking selection: PASS
- Temporary QA route removed before build; route count remains unchanged

**Manual QA Note:**
- An authenticated CRM session was unavailable, so one final protected-route visual pass with live branch data remains recommended.

---

### 2026-06-17 - Codex (CRM-AUTHORIZATION-CONSISTENCY-001)

**Task:** Fix CRM Staff service assignments and align the local staff-service authorization/save path.

**Files Added:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260617141348_crm_staff_service_capabilities_rpc.sql` - transactional SECURITY INVOKER staff service capability replacement RPC plus branch-scoped `staff_services` operational RLS policies.
- `src/lib/staff/service-assignment-state.ts` - deterministic local assignment replacement helper.
- `tests/lib/staff/service-assignment-state.test.ts` - local-state replacement regression tests.
- `docs/CRM_AUTHORIZATION_INVENTORY.md` - focused CRM authorization inventory and live DB inspection status.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/actions/crm-staff-services.ts` - now validates CRM staff-service access, calls `replace_staff_service_capabilities`, returns authoritative saved service IDs, logs safe technical errors, avoids raw DB messages, and revalidates affected CRM/public surfaces.
- `src/lib/queries/crm-services.ts` - no longer hides `staff_services` SELECT errors as empty assignments; assignment reads are scoped through active branch staff and requested active service IDs.
- `src/components/features/crm/staff/*` - passes assignment-load errors to the Staff UI, avoids false empty summaries, updates local assignment rows immediately after save, and removes timeout-based modal close dependency.
- `src/lib/auth/crm-permissions.ts` - exports the CRM staff-service role source and owner-only cross-branch helper.
- `src/types/supabase.ts` - adds the new RPC type.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/staff/page.tsx` - distinguishes assignment query failure from legitimate empty data.

**Immediate Culprits Fixed:**
- Hidden `staff_services` read errors were previously converted to `[]`, causing the table to display `No services assigned`.
- Staff service saves previously used separate delete and insert requests, risking capability loss if insertion failed.
- The UI relied on `router.refresh()` plus a timeout instead of updating from the saved authoritative service IDs.

**Database Design:**
- New RPC validates authenticated actor, CRM role, target staff, branch scope, privileged target protection for non-owner roles, active branch services, and duplicate service IDs before changing rows.
- Replacement happens inside one PostgreSQL function call, so any failure rolls back the full delete/insert sequence.
- RLS remains enabled; the RPC is SECURITY INVOKER, not a service-role bypass.

**Verification:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: PASS
- `npx vitest tests/lib/staff/service-assignment-state.test.ts`: PASS, 3 tests
- `pnpm lint`: PASS, 0 errors and 4 pre-existing warnings
- `pnpm test`: PASS, 52 files / 528 tests
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 100 routes

**Blocked / Manual Follow-up:**
- Live Supabase policy inspection and migration dry-run are blocked from this environment because `supabase db query --linked` and `supabase db push --linked --dry-run` hung.
- Local `supabase db lint --local --schema public` could not connect because local Postgres was not running.
- Apply migration `20260617141348` from an environment with working Supabase access, inspect `pg_policies`, then run a real authenticated CRM save on `/crm/staff?tab=assignments`.

## 2026-06-20 - Kimi (AGENT-CRM-COACH-001 - CRM AI Coach)

**Task:** Build the first CradleHub AI agent — a CRM Coach that guides front-desk/CRM users, detects idle users, offers proactive tips, answers questions, and suggests one-click actions.

**Files Changed:**
- `.env.example` - added `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `AGENT_COACH_WORKSPACES`.
- `src/lib/agents/types.ts` - shared agent types, workspaces, messages, and suggested actions.
- `src/lib/agents/config.ts` - feature flags and workspace enablement.
- `src/lib/agents/audit.ts` - immutable audit logging to `agent_audit_logs`.
- `src/lib/agents/crm/prompts.ts` - CRM system prompt, suggested actions, proactive greetings.
- `src/app/api/agent/coach/route.ts` - Claude 3.5 Sonnet coach endpoint with structured output.
- `src/components/agent/agent-context-provider.tsx` - page context + idle detection provider.
- `src/components/agent/coach-bubble.tsx` - floating chat bubble with sheet UI.
- `src/components/agent/inline-tip.tsx` - proactive tip after 45s of inactivity.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/layout.tsx` - mounts coach components in CRM workspace.
- `supabase/migrations/20260620140000_agent_audit_logs.sql` - audit table + owner RLS policy.
- `src/types/supabase.ts` - added `agent_audit_logs` table types.

**Behavior:**
- CRM users see a floating "Cradle Coach" button on every `/crm/*` page.
- Opening the chat shows a context-aware greeting and answers natural-language questions.
- Coach replies include up to 3 suggested one-click actions (links only, suggest-only, no data mutations).
- After 45 seconds of inactivity, a proactive inline tip appears with relevant guidance.
- Every interaction is logged to `agent_audit_logs` for owner review.
- The coach is disabled unless `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is configured.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS
- `pnpm lint`: PASS (0 errors, 4 pre-existing warnings)
- `pnpm test -- --run`: PASS, 52 files / 528 tests
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 101 routes

**Follow-up:**
- Apply migration `20260620140000_agent_audit_logs.sql` to the live Supabase project.
- Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to `.env.local` and production environment variables.
- Build an owner-facing review UI for `agent_audit_logs`.
- Expand coach to owner/manager/staff-portal workspaces and add one-click confirm actions.

---

## 2026-06-20 - Kimi (AGENT-CRM-COACH-002 - Agent Tools)

**Task:** Add three one-click agent tools to the CRM Coach: create reminder task, check available slots, and pre-fill walk-in booking.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/agents/types.ts` - added tool action keys.
- `src/lib/agents/tools.ts` - new tool implementations.
- `src/lib/agents/crm/prompts.ts` - CRM prompt now describes available tools and when to use them.
- `src/app/api/agent/act/route.ts` - new endpoint to execute confirmed tool actions.
- `src/app/api/agent/coach/route.ts` - passes tool-capable actions through.
- `src/components/agent/coach-bubble.tsx` - chat UI now handles tool confirmation, execution, and result display.
- `.context/CURRENT_TASK.cmd.md` - updated task description.

**Behavior:**
- Coach can suggest `create_reminder_task`, `check_available_slots`, or `prefill_walk_in_booking`.
- User taps the action button to confirm.
- `/api/agent/act` runs the tool server-side and returns a result message.
- Every tool execution is logged to `agent_audit_logs`.
- All actions remain suggest-only; nothing happens without user confirmation.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS
- `pnpm lint`: PASS (0 errors, 4 pre-existing warnings)
- `pnpm test -- --run`: PASS, 52 files / 528 tests
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 102 routes

**Follow-up:**
- Add more tools: record payment reminder, assign therapist, check booking status.
- Build follow-up/escalation agent for overdue bookings and tasks.

---

## 2026-06-30 - Codex (CRM-STABILIZATION-HANDOFF-2026-06-30)

**Task:** Update the active CRM stabilization/refactor handoff so future agents can resume safely if the current Codex session stops.

**Files Changed:**
- `.context/CURRENT_TASK.cmd.md` - replaced stale CRM Coach active task with the current CRM stabilization/refactor state.
- `.context/HANDOFF.cmd.md` - replaced stale CRM Coach next-agent note with current CRM stabilization pickup guidance.
- `.context/CHANGELOG.cmd.md` - appended this handoff update.
- `.context/ERRORS.cmd.md` - logged pre-flight path mismatch / stale handoff risk.
- `docs/CURRENT_TASK.cmd.md` - mirrored the active CRM stabilization task.
- `docs/HANDOFF.cmd.md` - mirrored next-agent pickup guidance.
- `docs/CHANGELOG.cmd.md` - appended docs-side handoff update.
- `docs/ERRORS.cmd.md` - logged docs-side pre-flight path mismatch / stale handoff risk.
- `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` - updated current status/latest agent update for CRM stabilization.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` - added roadmap changelog entry for the CRM stabilization handoff.
- `docs/FRONT_DESK_REFACTOR_PROGRESS.md` - added agent continuation protocol and latest prompt direction reconciliation.

**Notes:**
- No application code was changed during this handoff-only update.
- The prior code checkpoint remains: richer `getFrontDeskContext()` plus Today/Bookings/Control/Live Operations context consolidation.
- Latest CRM prompt wants `Work Queue`, `Bookings`, `Schedule`, `Customers`, `Home Service`, plus collapsed `System Management`; older checkpoint still says `Front Desk`, `Dispatch`, and `Admin & Setup`.

**Validation:**
- Not rerun for this docs-only update.
- Last code checkpoint passed `npm run type-check`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build`.

---

## 2026-06-30 - Codex (CRM-STABILIZATION-CHECKPOINT-1-NAV-SHELL-2026-06-30)

**Task:** Implement Checkpoint 1 of the focused CRM stabilization prompt: update the CRM sidebar primary destinations and move management tools into a quiet collapsed System Management section.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/dashboard/nav-config.ts` - changed CRM primary labels to `Work Queue`, `Bookings`, `Schedule`, `Customers`, and `Home Service`; added System Management link definitions for existing setup/staff/schedule/reconciliation routes.
- `src/components/features/dashboard/sidebar.tsx` - added query-aware nav highlighting, hover-prefetch opt-out support for secondary links, and a bottom collapsed `SYSTEM / System Management` section with gear icon.
- `src/components/features/workspace/workspace-prefetch-config.ts` - limited CRM automatic prefetching to primary daily routes; secondary system routes remain explicit-navigation only.
- `.context/CURRENT_TASK.cmd.md` and `docs/CURRENT_TASK.cmd.md` - updated active task to this checkpoint.

**Behavior:**
- Management-authorized CRM workspace users now see the approved five daily CRM destinations.
- `Admin & Setup` no longer competes as a primary CRM sidebar item.
- System tools remain available through a visually quieter collapsed System Management area.
- Existing route paths were preserved: `/crm/today`, `/crm/bookings`, `/crm/schedule`, `/crm/customers`, `/crm/dispatch`, `/crm/setup`, `/crm/staff`, `/crm/staff-availability`, and `/crm/reconciliation`.
- System Management links use current routes/deep links instead of creating a new manager workspace or new route tree.

**Verification:**
- `npm run type-check`: PASS
- `npm run lint`: PASS with 4 unrelated existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs` and `tests/components/payroll/employee-payroll-table.test.tsx`.
- `npm run build`: PASS, 103 generated app routes.
- `git diff --check`: PASS, line-ending notices only.

**Remaining Risks / Follow-up:**
- Header work from the prompt is not complete in this checkpoint: compact CRM page title, branch/search/New Booking header behavior still needs a dedicated pass.
- System Management follows the current management-authorized route gates. The latest prompt's broader "CRM users can occasionally edit system tools" direction still needs a deliberate permission/page-gate review before exposing those tools to ordinary CRM/CSR roles.
- No authenticated browser click-through was performed; protected CRM action flows still need a real CRM/front-desk session before claiming workflow readiness.

---

## 2026-06-30 - Codex (CRM-BOOKINGS-QUICK-BOOKING-COMPLETION-2026-06-30)

**Task:** Finish the interrupted CRM Bookings / Quick Booking checkpoint without restarting the Work Queue refactor.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/bookings/new/page.tsx` - loads branch services, staff, resources, customer prefill, and booking rules for the CRM Quick Booking form.
- `src/components/features/bookings/quick-booking-form.tsx` - added the CRM form for walk-in, phone, future, and home-service bookings with customer search, inline customer entry, More Options, next-slot selection, and date-aware success redirect.
- `src/lib/actions/inhouse-booking.ts` - aligned schema/action payload handling, customer upsert, home-service metadata, payment pending/paid state, resource fallback, checked-in walk-ins, safe errors, and best-effort revalidation.
- `src/lib/validations/booking.ts` - added the Quick Booking contract fields and clearer validation messages.
- `src/components/features/bookings/bookings-workspace.tsx` - finalized Needs Action, Upcoming, Active, and Completed grouping.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/bookings/page.tsx` - branch-scoped booking date lookup for bookingId links.
- `src/app/api/customers/search/route.ts` - aligned CRM role access with the page/action role gate.
- `src/lib/bookings/revalidate-booking-surfaces.ts` - revalidates schedule and dispatch booking surfaces.
- `.context/CURRENT_TASK.cmd.md`, `.context/HANDOFF.cmd.md`, `docs/FRONT_DESK_REFACTOR_PROGRESS.md` - concise verification/handoff updates.

**Behavior:**
- Quick Booking now supports walk-in, phone, standard future, and home-service modes through the existing `createInhouseBookingMultiAction`.
- New customers can be created inline; existing customers can be searched by name or phone.
- Home service captures address, city/barangay, landmark, and location notes without requiring a room.
- Next Available searches forward and respects branch booking rules before choosing a slot.
- Successful saves open the Bookings drawer with `date` and `bookingId` in the URL.
- Payment state is no longer hard-coded paid: walk-ins default paid, phone/future/home-service default pending unless payment is recorded.

**Verification:**
- `npm run type-check`: PASS
- `npm run lint`: PASS with 4 unrelated existing warnings.
- `npm run build`: PASS, 103 app routes.
- Authenticated CRM browser QA: PASS for walk-in, phone, future, and home-service booking creation; Bookings tabs; booking drawer; no browser console/runtime logs.
- RLS errors: none surfaced during verified authenticated flows.

**Notes:**
- A temporary CRM verifier account was created for QA, then disabled/unlinked and deleted from Supabase Auth after verification.
- QA bookings created during browser verification remain in the database as synthetic test records.

---

## 2026-06-30 - Codex (CRM-ADMIN-BOOKING-MODALS-SCHEDULE-ACTIONS-2026-06-30)

**Task:** Add the shared administrative booking modal and wire active CRM Schedule actions to in-context modals.

**Files Added:**
- `src/lib/queries/quick-booking-options.ts`
- `src/lib/actions/administrative-booking.ts`
- `src/components/features/bookings/administrative-booking-modal-provider.tsx`
- `src/components/features/crm/schedule/check-availability-modal.tsx`

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/layout.tsx` - mounts the administrative booking modal provider for CRM routes.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/bookings/new/page.tsx` - now uses shared quick-booking option helpers while preserving direct route access.
- `src/components/features/bookings/quick-booking-form.tsx` - supports modal prefill, stay-on-success behavior, cancel/success callbacks, and dirty-state reporting.
- Major CRM booking trigger surfaces under Bookings, Today/Work Queue, Customers, Waitlist, Setup flow cards, direct customer profile, and Schedule header now open the modal instead of routing to `/crm/bookings/new`.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/schedule/actions.ts` - added branch-authorized staff profile payload loading for the Schedule profile modal.
- Schedule Daily Timeline components now open Add Booking, Check Availability, Edit Staff Profile, View Full Schedule, Adjust Staff, and Block Staff Time modals in place.
- Existing availability/block-time editor now supports `initialTab` and selected-date block form prefill.

**Behavior:**
- Internal CRM New Booking triggers use the shared modal while `/crm/bookings/new` remains available for direct/legacy access.
- Schedule users can create bookings, check slots, inspect staff, view complete schedules, and block time without leaving `/crm/schedule`.
- Check Availability can select an available slot and hand it directly to the booking modal with service/staff/date/time prefilled.
- Unsaved booking and schedule editor protections remain in place.

**Verification:**
- `npm run type-check`: PASS
- `npm run lint`: PASS with 4 unrelated existing warnings.
- `npm run build`: PASS, 103 app routes.
- Browser smoke via `agent-browser`: public home route loads with content and no Next.js error overlay; unauthenticated `/crm/schedule` redirects to `/login`, which loads with content and no Next.js error overlay.

**Remaining Manual QA:**
- Authenticated CRM browser pass is still needed for the new modal flows because this session did not have an authenticated CRM browser state.

---

## 2026-07-01 - Codex (CRM-SCHEDULE-WORKSPACE-COMPLETION-2026-07-01)

**Task:** Complete the active CRM Schedule workspace before authenticated QA while preserving the shared administrative booking modal and existing CRM routes.

**Files Added:**
- `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/full-schedule-live-bookings-view.tsx`

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/schedule/workspace/schedule-workspace-header.tsx` - adds the Daily Timeline / Full Schedule + Live Bookings view toggle.
- `src/components/features/schedule/workspace/schedule-workspace-shell.tsx` - owns shared staff/booking selection and `view` query-param state across Schedule views.
- `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/daily-timeline-tab.tsx` - removes first-visible-staff fallback and wires explicit selection plus shared modal actions.
- `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/daily-timeline-selection-card.tsx` - adds no-selection copy and Edit Profile, Edit Capabilities, and View Full Schedule actions.
- `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/daily-timeline-staff-row.tsx` - renders overlapping bookings in vertical lanes with conflict indicators.
- `src/lib/utils/schedule-timeline.ts` - adds reusable timeline lane assignment utilities.
- `src/lib/actions/crm-staff-services.ts` - revalidates `/crm/schedule` after staff capability updates.

**Behavior:**
- Schedule no longer auto-selects staff; profile/capability/full-schedule actions require an explicit staff selection and show selection feedback when needed.
- Daily Timeline and Full Schedule share selected staff and selected booking state inside `/crm/schedule`.
- Full Schedule + Live Bookings provides a master-detail staff schedule with Day/Week mode, layer toggles, shifts, live bookings, blocked time, overrides, no-shift states, and conflict flags.
- Booking blocks use lane assignment so overlapping bookings remain visible instead of stacking on top of one another.
- Full Schedule booking clicks open the in-Schedule booking detail panel using the real booking id.
- Edit Capabilities reuses the existing staff service-capabilities sheet and server action rather than introducing a new mutation path.

**Permissions / Migrations:**
- No new migration was added.
- Existing relevant coverage remains in:
  - `supabase/migrations/20260529000002_crm_csr_schedule_rls.sql`
  - `supabase/migrations/20260529000003_crm_csr_staff_update_rls.sql`
  - `supabase/migrations/20260617141348_crm_staff_service_capabilities_rpc.sql`
- Supabase changelog was checked on 2026-07-01; no new-table Data API exposure change applies because this checkpoint added no tables.

**Verification:**
- `npm run type-check`: PASS
- `npm run lint`: PASS with 4 unrelated existing warnings.
- `npm run build`: PASS, 103 app routes.
- `git diff --check`: PASS, line-ending notices only.
- Browser smoke via `agent-browser`: unauthenticated `/crm/schedule` redirects to `/login`, login renders, and no page errors are reported.

**Remaining Manual QA:**
- Authenticated CRM Schedule browser pass is still needed for Daily Timeline actions, Full Schedule + Live Bookings, Edit Capabilities save, conflict/lane inspection, and booking-detail panel verification.

---

## 2026-07-02 - Codex (ATTENDANCE-QR-001)

**Task:** Build and wire the complete CradleHub QR Attendance and Service Session system.

**Files Added:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260702075213_attendance_qr_system.sql`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/attendance/actions.ts`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/attendance/page.tsx`
- `src/app/scan/[publicCode]/page.tsx`
- `src/app/scan/activate/[token]/page.tsx`
- `src/app/scan/actions.ts`
- `src/components/features/attendance/attendance-workspace.tsx`
- `src/components/features/attendance/public-scan-processor.tsx`
- `src/lib/attendance/db.ts`
- `src/lib/attendance/qr-code.ts`
- `src/lib/attendance/queries.ts`
- `src/lib/attendance/scan-engine.ts`
- `src/lib/attendance/time.ts`
- `src/lib/attendance/time.test.ts`
- `src/lib/attendance/tokens.ts`
- `src/lib/attendance/types.ts`

**Files Changed:**
- `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml` - added `qrcode` and `@types/qrcode`.
- `src/components/features/dashboard/nav-config.ts` - added CRM Attendance navigation.
- `src/components/features/workspace/workspace-prefetch-config.ts` - added Attendance CRM route warm-up.
- `src/lib/agents/crm/prompts.ts` - documented `/crm/attendance`.
- `src/types/supabase.ts` - manually augmented attendance-related generated types after linked type generation exposed unrelated schema drift.
- `.context/CURRENT_TASK.cmd.md`, `.context/HANDOFF.cmd.md`, `docs/CURRENT_TASK.cmd.md`, `docs/HANDOFF.cmd.md`, `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md` - updated task memory and roadmap notes.

**Database / Security:**
- Added tables: `qr_points`, `staff_devices`, `device_activation_tokens`, `qr_scan_events`, `attendance_exceptions`, `attendance_corrections`, `attendance_settings`.
- Extended `staff_shift_checkins` with QR/source/schedule/metric fields.
- Extended `bookings` with service-session duration/due/completion/source fields.
- Added RPC `public.complete_due_service_sessions(p_limit integer default 100)`.
- Applied the migration to the linked Supabase project via `supabase db query --linked --file`, then reran after grant tightening.
- Verified live tables, columns, RPC, authenticated SELECT-only grants on readable attendance tables, no authenticated grant on `device_activation_tokens`, and RLS policy shape.
- `pg_cron` is not installed on the linked project, so automatic cron scheduling was not created.

**Behavior:**
- CRM `/crm/attendance` now provides Overview, Attendance Records, Service Sessions, QR Codes, Registered Devices, Exceptions, and Reports tabs.
- CRM users can generate permanent branch attendance QR and room/resource QR points, create one-time device activation links, revoke devices, resolve exceptions, and run due-session completion manually.
- Public `/scan/activate/[token]` activates a staff device and stores the credential in an HttpOnly scan cookie.
- Public `/scan/[publicCode]` processes attendance and room/resource scans server-side.
- Attendance scans handle unknown QR, unknown/revoked/wrong-branch devices, duplicate scans, schedule-aware exceptions, clock-in/out, and active-service clock-out blocking.
- Room/resource scans start eligible checked-in service sessions and can reopen the countdown for an already active session.

**Verification:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false`: PASS
- `npm run lint`: PASS with 4 unrelated existing warnings.
- `npx vitest run src/lib/attendance/time.test.ts`: PASS, 1 file / 3 tests.
- `npm run build`: PASS, 104 app routes.

**Remaining Manual QA / Caveats:**
- Authenticated browser QA is still needed for `/crm/attendance`, device activation, real attendance scans, room/resource scans, and blocked/revoked/wrong-branch duplicate flows.
- Migration history may not be reconciled because the migration was applied through `db query --file`, not a successful `db push`.
- `npm run db:types` is stale for the current Supabase CLI because it uses removed `--project-ref`.
- Two zero-byte `_tmp_14412_*` files remain after scoped deletion returned Access denied.

**Follow-up Fix - 2026-07-02:**
- Fixed runtime `insert or update on table "qr_points" violates foreign key constraint "qr_points_branch_id_fkey"`.
- Root cause was Attendance server actions using the dev-bypass zero UUID branch before trying the authenticated staff branch.
- Added `src/lib/dev-bypass-server.ts` to resolve dev bypass to a real active branch.
- Updated Attendance and CRM context resolution to prefer real staff branch data and use the real dev branch fallback only when needed.
- Added branch validation before attendance settings/QR inserts.
- Verified `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false` and `npm run lint`; linked DB query confirmed no zero UUID branch and a valid active branch fallback.

## 2026-07-02 - Codex (ATTENDANCE-REFIT-005)

**Task:** Refit the entire CRM Attendance workspace UI/actions without rebuilding the database, scan engine, service-session engine, device activation flow, or Supabase security model.

**Files Added:**
- `src/lib/attendance/tabs.ts`
- `src/lib/attendance/qr-url.ts`
- `src/lib/attendance/qr-print-layout.ts`
- `src/lib/attendance/qr-filenames.ts`
- `src/components/features/attendance/attendance-header.tsx`
- `src/components/features/attendance/attendance-tabs.tsx`
- `src/components/features/attendance/attendance-ui.tsx`
- `src/components/features/attendance/overview/*`
- `src/components/features/attendance/records/attendance-records-tab.tsx`
- `src/components/features/attendance/sessions/service-sessions-tab.tsx`
- `src/components/features/attendance/devices/registered-devices-tab.tsx`
- `src/components/features/attendance/exceptions/attendance-exceptions-tab.tsx`
- `src/components/features/attendance/reports/attendance-reports-tab.tsx`
- `src/components/features/attendance/qr-codes/*`
- `tests/lib/attendance/tabs.test.ts`
- `tests/lib/attendance/qr-url.test.ts`
- `tests/lib/attendance/qr-print-layout.test.ts`
- `tests/lib/attendance/qr-filenames.test.ts`

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/attendance/page.tsx` - keeps one route while delegating to the client workspace without duplicate page header.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/attendance/actions.ts` - returns typed `AttendanceActionResult` values instead of redirecting after routine mutations.
- `src/components/features/attendance/attendance-workspace.tsx` - owns local tab/data/selection state and keeps tab panels mounted for state preservation.
- `src/components/features/dashboard/nav-config.ts` - Attendance icon changed to supported `ClipboardCheck`.
- `src/lib/attendance/queries.ts` - room QR generation returns created QR points and added QR deactivate mutation.
- `src/lib/attendance/qr-code.ts` - delegates URL helpers to shared client-safe QR URL utilities.
- `src/lib/attendance/types.ts` - tab label updated to `QR Codes`.
- `.context/*` and `docs/*` - updated task, handoff, decisions, errors, roadmap, and project notes.

**Behavior:**
- `/crm/attendance` remains the single protected Attendance route.
- Overview, Records, Sessions, QR Codes, Devices, Exceptions, and Reports switch instantly with local client state and `window.history.replaceState()`.
- Attendance tab panels stay mounted, preserving filters, selected QR, selected format, activation link, and dialogs while switching tabs.
- KPI-card rows were removed from the Attendance workspace.
- Overview now focuses on live staff status, recent scan activity, active service sessions, exceptions requiring attention, and compact quick actions.
- QR Codes now uses a compact QR list and one selected branded preview with print formats, download PNG/SVG, print, copy scan link, QR information, generation actions, and deactivate QR.
- Records, Sessions, Devices, Exceptions, and Reports are compact operational workspaces with filters/tables/actions instead of placeholder dashboards.
- Server-action success/error results update local UI state and toasts without route refresh/query-status redirects.
- Public QR URL generation rejects localhost in production and masks public codes in UI display.

**Root Causes Addressed:**
- Slow tabs came from URL-driven tab changes and route work; the refit keeps the workspace mounted and only mirrors tab state into history.
- `NEXT_REDIRECT` surfaced because Attendance actions used redirect/status-query flows for routine mutations; actions now return typed results to the client.
- The missing sidebar icon came from using `QrCode`, which was not in the sidebar icon map; `ClipboardCheck` already existed.

**Validation:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false`: PASS
- `npx vitest run tests/lib/attendance/tabs.test.ts tests/lib/attendance/qr-url.test.ts tests/lib/attendance/qr-print-layout.test.ts tests/lib/attendance/qr-filenames.test.ts`: PASS, 4 files / 14 tests.
- `npm run lint`: PASS with 4 unrelated existing warnings.
- `npm run build`: PASS, 104 app routes.
- `npm test -- --run`: PASS outside sandbox after sandboxed Vite config load failed with Windows `spawn EPERM`; 60 files / 564 tests.
- `git diff --check`: PASS, line-ending notices only.
- Browser smoke via `agent-browser`: existing `http://localhost:3000/crm/attendance` redirects unauthenticated to `/login`; login renders content and no Next/Vite overlay is present.

**Remaining Manual QA / Caveats:**
- Authenticated CRM browser QA is still needed for the live Attendance workspace tabs, server actions, device activation, QR scan flows, and room/resource service-session scans.
- Existing `ATTENDANCE-QR-001` caveats still apply: no pg_cron install, migration history may need reconciliation, stale `db:types` script, and two locked `_tmp_14412_*` files.

---

## 2026-07-02 - Codex (ATTENDANCE-REFIT-005 FINAL VERIFICATION CONTINUATION)

**Task:** Complete the remaining Attendance QR verification/cleanup using `pnpm`, resolve lint warnings, rerun the full suite, attempt browser visual QA, and document blockers precisely.

**Files Changed:**
- `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs` - removed unused `FALLBACK_IMAGE_URL` and replaced the `generationPrompt` rest-omit pattern with an explicit `appManifestEntry()` mapper.
- `tests/components/payroll/employee-payroll-table.test.tsx` - kept typed staff-id mock arguments and marked them intentionally unused with `void staffId`.
- `.context/*` and `docs/*` - recorded final pnpm verification, lint warning resolution, visual QA blocker, screenshot evidence, and remaining manual scan requirements.

**Original Four Lint Warnings Resolved:**
- `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs:26`, `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`: removed unused `FALLBACK_IMAGE_URL`.
- `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs:523`, `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`: replaced unused `generationPrompt` destructuring with explicit app-manifest projection.
- `tests/components/payroll/employee-payroll-table.test.tsx:17`, `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`: preserved mock signature and used `void staffId`.
- `tests/components/payroll/employee-payroll-table.test.tsx:18`, `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`: preserved mock signature and used `void staffId`.

**Validation:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS, 0 warnings.
- `pnpm test`: PASS, 60 files / 564 tests.
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 104 app routes.
- Final pnpm checks ran outside the restricted sandbox with `CI=true` because sandboxed pnpm script startup hit Windows `EPERM` temp-file cleanup before scripts could run.

**Browser / Export QA:**
- Dev server started at `http://localhost:3000`.
- Required route `/crm/attendance?tab=qr` was checked at 1440, 1280, 1024, 768, and 375 px widths.
- All widths redirected to `/login` because the local browser has no authenticated Supabase CRM/front-desk session. Starting the dev server with `DEV_AUTH_BYPASS=true` did not bypass this, because `src/proxy.ts` still requires a real Supabase user before the dev bypass skips staff-record checks.
- Blocker screenshots captured:
  - `E:\cradlehub\.codex-artifacts\attendance-qr-qa\blocked-login-1440.png`
  - `E:\cradlehub\.codex-artifacts\attendance-qr-qa\blocked-login-1024.png`
  - `E:\cradlehub\.codex-artifacts\attendance-qr-qa\blocked-login-375.png`
- Browser console/page errors for the blocked session: no Next/Vite overlay and no page errors; only normal React DevTools, HMR, and Vercel Speed Insights development messages.

**Remaining Manual QA / Caveats:**
- Authenticated QR visual QA is still blocked until a valid CRM/front-desk browser session is available.
- Real interactions are not approved yet: select QR row(s), format changes, search/filter, copy link, PNG/SVG/download/print/export, print selected, and deactivate confirmation.
- Real phone scanning is not complete: attendance PNG, room SVG, and print/PDF preview still need scanning with a phone camera against real exported artifacts.
- QR identity preservation still needs live browser confirmation before/after preview/export for QR point ID, public code, scan URL, and version.
- Local Supabase CLI package binary exists after dependency restoration, but `pnpm exec supabase --version` currently hits a Windows file-lock error: `The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.` Retry after the lock clears if Supabase CLI work is needed.

## 2026-07-03 - ATTENDANCE-SCHEDULE-REPAIR-002

- Stabilized the CRM Schedule Daily Timeline failure path by logging the real branch/date/error message instead of an empty object, returning a safe operator-facing error, and applying `Cache-Control: private, no-store` to both success and failure responses.
- Updated the daily schedule query to select and carry `schedule_overrides.shift_type`, fail loudly on staff metadata, blocked-time, and override query errors, and preserve shift-type labels for timed overrides in the live schedule views.
- Rewired the Schedule workspace around live SWR data, explicit refresh tokens, and derived selected staff/booking IDs so setup changes refresh the current tab without a router refresh or stale local selection effects.
- Fixed the Attendance QR insert mapper regression by passing the inserted QR row through the expected `mapQrPoint` shape.
- Added focused schedule tests covering missing `schedule_overrides.shift_type` and staff metadata query failures.
- Live database verification through the Supabase pooler confirmed `schedule_overrides.shift_type` exists, has the expected check constraint, contains no invalid values, and `get_daily_schedule` returns rows for the active SM branch on 2026-07-03.
- Validation passed with `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint`, focused schedule Vitest coverage, full `npx vitest run`, `npm run build`, and `git diff --check`.
- `pnpm db:push` and `pnpm db:types` remain blocked by the local pnpm/Supabase CLI environment: ignored Supabase build scripts, EPERM rename/unlink failures, and migration history not synchronized for `20260703022600`.
- Security note: a live database password was pasted during repair. Rotate the Supabase database password before production deployment.

---

## 2026-07-03 - Codex (ATTENDANCE-FULL-INTEGRATION-002 FEED/DEEPLINK SLICE)

**Task:** Integrate live attendance scan visibility into the CRM Work Queue and Owner overview without creating a second attendance system.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/attendance/recent-scans.ts`, `src/lib/attendance/recent-scans-map.ts`, `src/lib/attendance/recent-scans-api.ts`, `src/lib/attendance/scan-feed.ts`, `src/lib/attendance/record-filters.ts`, `src/lib/attendance/owner-attendance-branch.ts`, `src/lib/attendance/tabs.ts` - added server query/API helpers, branch/context helpers, and pure feed/tab URL/status formatting helpers.
- `src/app/api/attendance/recent-scans/route.ts` - added authenticated no-store refresh endpoint for the feed.
- `src/components/features/attendance/attendance-scan-feed-card.tsx`, `attendance-scan-feed-row.tsx`, `use-attendance-scan-feed.ts`, `use-attendance-scan-realtime.ts` - added reusable live feed UI with SWR refresh and Supabase realtime invalidation.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/today/page.tsx`, `crm-today-shell.tsx`, `work-queue-dashboard.tsx` - rendered the feed at the top of the Work Queue right rail.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/page.tsx`, `src/components/features/owner/dashboard/owner-dashboard.tsx`, `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/attendance/page.tsx` - rendered the same feed on Owner overview and reused the existing Attendance workspace for selected-branch owner attendance links.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/attendance/page.tsx`, `attendance-workspace.tsx`, `records/attendance-records-tab.tsx`, `records/attendance-record-readout.tsx` - added server-validated `staffId`/`date` record filters, row highlighting, and staff profile links.
- `src/lib/attendance/types.ts` - added feed and record-filter types.
- `tests/lib/attendance/scan-feed.test.ts`, `tests/lib/attendance/tabs.test.ts` - added focused helper coverage.

**Behavior:**
- CRM Work Queue now shows recent successful attendance clock-in/out scans from the authoritative `qr_scan_events` trail.
- The feed refreshes through `/api/attendance/recent-scans` and invalidates on Supabase Realtime insert events.
- Feed rows deep-link to `/crm/attendance?tab=records&staffId=...&date=...`; the Records tab applies the filters and highlights the matching row.
- Invalid staff/date/branch parameters are rejected server-side by the branch-scoped Attendance page data.
- Owner overview reuses the same feed component. `/owner/attendance` loads the selected branch through the existing `AttendanceWorkspace`, so there is still one Attendance module.
- Owner attendance tab switching stays on `/owner/attendance` and preserves the selected `branchId`.

**Validation:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false`: PASS.
- `npx vitest run tests/lib/attendance/scan-feed.test.ts tests/lib/attendance/tabs.test.ts`: PASS, 2 files / 9 tests.
- `npm run lint`: PASS.
- `npm run build`: PASS, 105 app routes.
- `git diff --check`: PASS, line-ending notices only.

**Remaining Caveats:**
- Authenticated browser QA is still required for the Work Queue/Owner card and Records deep-link flow.
- The full first-scan trusted-device sign-in/linking flow, Staff Portal My Attendance, and staff profile attendance history remain outside this completed slice.
- `pnpm db:push`, `pnpm db:types`, Supabase migration-history reconciliation, and database password rotation remain deployment blockers.

---

## 2026-07-03 - Codex (DATABASE-CONNECTION-STABILIZATION-001)

**Task:** Reset the broken Supabase database tooling workflow into a secure reusable local process.

**Files Added:**
- `scripts/database/_shared.mjs`
- `scripts/database/db-doctor.mjs`
- `scripts/database/db-status.mjs`
- `scripts/database/db-verify.mjs`
- `scripts/database/db-types.mjs`
- `scripts/database/db-link.mjs`
- `scripts/database/db-push.mjs`
- `scripts/database/db-migration-new.mjs`
- `docs/DATABASE_CONNECTION_RUNBOOK.md`

**Files Changed:**
- `.gitignore` - unignored `.env.example` while keeping `.env.local` and `.env.database.local` ignored.
- `.env.example` - added placeholders for app Supabase config and local-only database tooling variables.
- `package.json` - replaced stale hardcoded Supabase scripts with safe database wrappers.
- `.context/CURRENT_TASK.cmd.md`, `.context/DECISIONS.cmd.md`, `.context/ERRORS.cmd.md`, `.context/HANDOFF.cmd.md` - registered the database stabilization task and documented findings.
- `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md` - recorded the tooling stabilization work and remaining blockers.

**Behavior:**
- Future database work now has `pnpm db:doctor`, `pnpm db:status`, `pnpm db:verify`, `pnpm db:link`, `pnpm db:push`, `pnpm db:types`, and `pnpm db:migration`.
- The scripts prefer the project-local Supabase CLI shim and mask sensitive values in output.
- Type generation writes through a temporary file and preserves the checked-in type file on failure.
- The transaction pooler remains documented as a diagnostic/emergency fallback, not the normal migration path.

**Current Blockers:**
- Database password rotation is not confirmed.
- Linked remote verification still depends on valid rotated local secrets and/or Supabase CLI auth.
- `psql` is not installed, so emergency transaction-pooler migration application remains documented but not executable here.

---

## 2026-07-03 - Codex (ATTENDANCE-DEVICE-REGISTRY-005)

**Task:** Build the Attendance Device Registry and Recovery Center backend first, then replace the Attendance Devices tab.

**Files Added:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260703151111_attendance_device_registry_recovery.sql`
- `docs/ATTENDANCE_DEVICE_REGISTRY_AUDIT.md`
- `src/lib/attendance/device-display.ts`
- `src/lib/attendance/device-registry.ts`
- `src/lib/attendance/device-registry-status.ts`
- `src/lib/attendance/device-recovery.ts`
- `src/components/features/attendance/device-recovery-screen.tsx`
- `src/components/features/attendance/devices/device-registry-toolbar.tsx`
- `src/components/features/attendance/devices/device-registry-table.tsx`
- `src/components/features/attendance/devices/selected-device-panel.tsx`
- `src/components/features/attendance/devices/pending-recovery-links.tsx`
- `src/components/features/attendance/devices/recovery-link-dialog.tsx`
- `src/components/features/attendance/devices/rename-device-dialog.tsx`
- `src/components/features/attendance/devices/revoke-device-dialog.tsx`
- `tests/lib/attendance/device-recovery.test.ts`

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/attendance/types.ts`, `tokens.ts`, `queries.ts`, `scan-engine.ts`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/attendance/actions.ts`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/attendance/page.tsx`
- `src/app/scan/actions.ts`
- `src/app/scan/activate/[token]/page.tsx`
- `src/components/features/attendance/attendance-workspace.tsx`
- `src/components/features/attendance/devices/registered-devices-tab.tsx`
- `src/types/supabase.ts`

**Behavior:**
- The Devices tab now shows a registry of staff/device rows, pending recovery links, selected-device detail panel, branch/status/staff-type/search filters, and CRM actions for recovery link generation, rename, pending-link revocation, and device revocation.
- Recovery links are one-time tokens stored only as raw SHA-256 hashes; raw recovery URLs are returned once to the CRM UI.
- `/scan/activate/[token]` now inspects recovery tokens without consuming them and consumes only after staff confirmation.
- Successful recovery consumption atomically creates a new trusted device credential, optionally revokes the previous device, marks the token used, and logs a `qr_scan_events` activation audit row without clocking attendance in/out.
- Existing first-scan/device credential hashing remains peppered through `hashSecret`; the new `cradle_attendance_device` cookie is set at path `/` while legacy `cradle_device` is still read for compatibility.

**Validation:**
- Live SQL probe: migration `20260703151111`, all new columns, `consume_attendance_device_recovery`, and `service_role` execute grant returned `ok`.
- `pnpm db:types`: PASS.
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS.
- `pnpm vitest run tests/lib/attendance/device-recovery.test.ts`: PASS, 1 file / 3 tests.
- `pnpm test`: PASS, 67 files / 595 tests.
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 105 app routes.
- `git diff --check`: PASS, line-ending notices only.

**Remaining Caveats:**
- `pnpm db:status` and `pnpm db:push` still time out on the Supabase pooler port `5432`; live schema was verified via linked SQL instead.
- Authenticated browser QA for the protected Devices tab and real phone recovery scan remains pending.
- `tmp-attendance-device-registry-verify.sql` remains untracked because sandbox deletion was denied and the elevated delete request was blocked by the environment usage limit.

---

## 2026-07-04 - Codex (ATTENDANCE-MOBILE-SCAN-FLOW-006)

**Task:** Inspect and finish the mobile Attendance QR scan flow wiring without replacing the existing scan engine, device registry, or Supabase-backed attendance business logic.

**Files Added:**
- `src/app/scan/[publicCode]/loading.tsx` - route-level mobile scan loading shell that immediately shows the recognizing animation while the App Router page resolves.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/scan/actions.ts` - wrapped public scan, first-scan activation, and recovery consumption in user-safe error fallbacks; preserved trusted-device cookie handling; revalidated existing Attendance surfaces after scan/recovery writes.
- `src/lib/attendance/types.ts` - extended `PublicScanResult` with backward-compatible `reasonCode`, `severity`, and `securityNote` fields.
- `src/lib/attendance/scan-engine.ts` - exposed structured reason codes/severity/security notes on public results while keeping existing event writes, branch/device checks, duplicate protection, and clock-in/out logic as the source of truth.
- `src/components/features/attendance/public-scan-result.tsx` - rendered security notes on generic blocked/error/recovery states and used reason codes for clearer result eyebrows.
- `src/components/features/attendance/public-scan-processor.module.css` - normalized scan typography letter spacing for mobile readability.

**Behavior:**
- `/scan/[publicCode]` still renders `PublicScanProcessor` and passes the async route `publicCode` into `processPublicQrScanAction`.
- The client processor still starts at `recognizing`, moves to `processing`, then settles on `result`; scan actions are invoked from `useEffect` after mount, not during server render.
- Blank-route time is covered by the new `loading.tsx`, and runtime action failures return a safe `"Scan interrupted"` result instead of crashing the public scanner.
- Successful attendance results include `attendance.action`, staff name, branch, shift label, scan time, session start, and worked minutes for clock-out.
- Duplicate, inactive QR, unknown-device, revoked-device, wrong-branch, active-service, already-checked-out, activation, recovery, and database-error paths now expose `reasonCode`/`severity` for the mobile UI while preserving existing `qr_scan_events` and `attendance_exceptions` writes.
- Active-service clock-out blocks now include the active service countdown card when the existing booking query can supply it.
- Public scan writes revalidate the existing Attendance surfaces through `revalidateAttendanceSurfaces()` (`/crm/attendance`, `/crm/availability`, `/crm/today`, `/staff-portal`).

**Validation:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS.
- `pnpm build`: PASS, Next.js 16.2.4, 105 app routes.
- Local dev server started with `pnpm exec next dev -H 0.0.0.0` on port `3000` (PID `31160`).
- Browser smoke via `agent-browser` on `http://localhost:3000/scan/test-public-code`: PASS. The invalid QR path rendered the public result screen (`QR not recognized`), body content was nonblank, and no Next.js/Vite error overlay was present.
- Annotated smoke screenshot: `C:\Users\eleur\.agent-browser\tmp\screenshots\screenshot-1783127833941.png`.

**Remaining Caveats:**
- Authenticated/live phone QA against real staff devices and real branch QR codes is still pending.
- Local manual phone testing should use the current LAN IP `192.168.137.149` with a dev server bound to all interfaces, for example `pnpm dev -- -H 0.0.0.0`, then open `http://192.168.137.149:3000/scan/<publicCode>` on the phone.
- Existing untracked local artifacts remain: `.attendance-scan-backups/` and `tmp-attendance-device-registry-verify.sql`.

---

## 2026-07-04 - Codex (ATTENDANCE-FIRST-SCAN-LOGIN-007)

**Task:** Replace the first-time Attendance QR missing-device dead end with staff sign-in, secure phone registration, and automatic continuation of the original scan.

**Files Added:**
- `src/components/features/attendance/public-scan-login-form.tsx` - mobile scan sign-in panel with email, password show/hide, clean form errors, and the trust note that the phone will be remembered for faster attendance scans.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/scan/actions.ts` - added `completeFirstTimeAttendanceScanAction`, scan-login input validation, Supabase password sign-in without workspace redirect, attendance-device cookie override support, and continuation request-id suffixes for register/attendance audit rows.
- `src/lib/attendance/scan-engine.ts` - added authenticated first-scan device registration that maps `auth.users.id` to the caller's own active `staff.auth_user_id`, enforces branch/device/staff ownership checks, inserts a pepper-hashed `staff_devices` credential, and blocks revoked/wrong-branch/device-mismatch cases.
- `src/components/features/attendance/public-scan-processor.tsx` - changed only `reasonCode: "unknown_device"` into the recoverable sign-in-required flow; other blocked/noop/success results still render through the existing result view.
- `src/components/features/attendance/public-scan-stage.tsx` - added `signing_in`, `registering_device`, `device_registered`, and `processing_attendance` stages.
- `src/components/features/attendance/public-scan-processor.module.css` - styled the sign-in form and connected-phone stage inside the existing mobile scan shell.
- `.context/HANDOFF.cmd.md`, `.context/ERRORS.cmd.md`, `.context/CHANGELOG.cmd.md` - documented the implementation, validation, and the duplicate-detection audit fix.

**Behavior:**
- First scan from an unregistered phone now goes `recognizing -> processing -> sign in` instead of ending at "Device not registered."
- Correct staff credentials register the current browser/phone to that authenticated staff member, set the existing `cradle_attendance_device` HttpOnly cookie pattern, briefly show `Registering this phone` and `Phone connected`, then automatically resume the same QR scan.
- Future scans from the same phone skip sign-in because the same scan engine resolves the stored attendance device credential.
- Wrong credentials stay on the sign-in form with clean copy.
- Accounts without an active staff profile, branch mismatches, revoked devices, and phones already linked to another staff account return friendly blocked results without registering a new phone.
- Duplicate scan protection, active-service clock-out protection, wrong-branch checks, and normal clock-in/out writes remain in `processQrScan`.
- Front-desk recovery links and `/scan/activate/[token]` remain intact as the admin fallback.

**Database Tables Touched At Runtime:**
- `staff` - maps the authenticated Supabase user to the active staff profile and branch.
- `qr_points` - validates the scanned public code and branch.
- `staff_devices` - inserts the new hashed attendance device credential with `registration_source = 'first_scan_activation'` and metadata source `first_scan_login`.
- `qr_scan_events` - records first-scan registration and the resumed attendance scan with separate request ids.
- `attendance_exceptions` - still records existing engine exceptions such as revoked/wrong-branch/unknown-device paths.
- `staff_shift_checkins` - updated only by the resumed normal attendance scan path.

**Validation:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS.
- `pnpm build`: PASS, Next.js 16.2.4, 105 app routes.

**Remaining Caveats:**
- Live phone QA with real staff credentials and a real branch attendance QR is still pending.
- CRM confirmation that the newly registered phone appears in the Device Registry requires an authenticated CRM session.
- Duplicate-window clock-in/noop/clock-out timing still needs real-device manual testing.

---

## 2026-07-04 - Codex (ATTENDANCE-FIRST-SCAN-LOGIN-008)

**Task:** Finish the first-scan Attendance login flow all the way through a valid active `staff_devices` row and a cookie-backed next scan that skips login.

**Files Added:**
- `src/app/api/attendance/public-scan/route.ts` - public scan POST route that reads `cradle_attendance_device` / legacy `cradle_device` directly from `NextRequest.cookies`, calls the existing scan engine, and returns a safe `PublicScanResult`.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/scan/actions.ts` - renamed the first-scan action to `signInAndRegisterAttendanceDeviceAction`; it now signs in, registers the phone, sets the HttpOnly device cookie, returns registration metadata, and leaves the actual attendance scan to the next browser request.
- `src/components/features/attendance/public-scan-processor.tsx` - fixed the scan effect dependency bug that stranded scans on `Processing scan...`; broadened missing-device detection; moved scan reads to the new API route; after phone registration, reloads the scan URL so the next request carries the browser cookie.
- `src/lib/attendance/scan-engine.ts` - changed unknown-device public copy to the recoverable sign-in state, blocked first-scan registration from non-attendance QRs, and disambiguated `staff_devices -> staff` / activation-token staff joins with explicit Supabase FK hints.
- `src/lib/attendance/queries.ts` - disambiguated the Attendance workspace `staff_devices -> staff` join.
- `src/lib/attendance/device-recovery.ts` - disambiguated the recovery-token `device_activation_tokens -> staff` join.
- `src/components/features/attendance/public-scan-result.tsx` - changed the unknown-device eyebrow from `Device setup needed` to `Staff sign-in`.

**Root Causes Fixed:**
- `PublicScanProcessor` depended on the full `props` object. When the recognition animation set `stage = processing`, React cleaned up the effect and marked the in-flight scan inactive; `startedRef` then prevented a restart, leaving the public page stuck on `Processing scan...`.
- The previous same-action continuation did not prove the browser stored and resent the HttpOnly cookie.
- Valid device cookies still resolved as unknown because Supabase rejected the embedded `staff(full_name, ...)` join on `staff_devices`; that table now has both `staff_id` and `revoked_by` relationships to `staff`, and `resolveDevice()` ignored the query error as `null`.

**Runtime Behavior Verified:**
- First unregistered scan returns `reasonCode = "unknown_device"` and renders the in-flow staff sign-in form.
- Staff sign-in writes `staff_devices.status = 'active'`, `registration_source = 'first_scan_activation'`, and metadata source `first_scan_login`.
- The device cookie remains `cradle_attendance_device`, HttpOnly, `SameSite=Lax`, path `/`, 180-day max age; `cradle_device` is still cleared/read only for legacy compatibility.
- The next scan request resolves the cookie to the active device row, skips login, and uses the normal attendance engine path.
- Live DB proof: device `9395ae4f-65c1-4005-b491-19309e3a4b26` for staff `35614315-6688-4599-b234-60071945333e` is active, has `last_attendance_scan_at = 2026-07-04T03:03:42.626+00:00`, and subsequent UI scan returned duplicate/noop instead of sign-in.
- Event proof: `qr_scan_events` contains `first_scan_device_registered` for device `9395ae4f-65c1-4005-b491-19309e3a4b26`, then `clock_in` success with the same `device_id`, then `duplicate_scan` noop with the same `device_id`.

**Validation:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS.
- `pnpm build`: PASS, Next.js 16.2.4, 106 app routes including `/api/attendance/public-scan`.
- Browser/MCP proof on local dev: a cookie-bearing scan page rendered `Already recorded` rather than the staff sign-in form, with `cradle_attendance_device` present as an HttpOnly cookie.

**Notes:**
- Temporary Codex QA auth/staff/device rows created during diagnosis were removed after verification.
- Existing untracked local artifacts remain intentionally untouched: `.attendance-scan-backups/` and `tmp-attendance-device-registry-verify.sql`.

## 2026-07-09 - Codex (BOOKING-ATTENDANCE-BRANCH-SAFETY-001)

**Task:** Separate booking schedule availability from attendance readiness, add same-day walk-in fallback warnings, and fix Attendance QR wrong-branch validation when `staff_devices.branch_id` is stale.

**Files Added:**
- `src/lib/attendance/branch-validation.ts` - pure QR/staff/device branch decision helper.
- `tests/lib/attendance/branch-validation.test.ts` - stale-device and wrong-branch branch decision coverage.
- `tests/lib/assignments/recommendation-engine.test.ts` - walk-in fallback and phone/future/home-service attendance-scoping coverage.
- `supabase/migrations/20260709054954_attendance_device_branch_sync.sql` - active device branch sync trigger plus one-time repair.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/engine/availability.ts` - added detailed therapist assignment with optional checked-in preference and scheduled fallback warning.
- `src/lib/actions/inhouse-booking.ts` - uses checked-in preference only for same-day walk-ins and returns fallback warning to the UI.
- `src/components/features/bookings/quick-booking-form.tsx` - surfaces the fallback warning in the booking success toast.
- `src/lib/assignments/recommendation-engine.ts` - check-in scoring now applies only to walk-in bookings happening today.
- `src/lib/queries/assignment-recommendations.ts` - carries CRM booking mode from booking metadata into recommendation context.
- `src/lib/attendance/scan-engine.ts` - QR branch checks now use scanned QR branch + current staff branch as source of truth and sync stale device branch ids.
- `.context/CURRENT_TASK.cmd.md`, `.context/HANDOFF.cmd.md`, `.context/CHANGELOG.cmd.md`, `.context/ERRORS.cmd.md`, `.context/DECISIONS.cmd.md` - updated task records.

**Behavior:**
- Future, phone, and home-service booking recommendations are schedule/conflict/service-capability based and no longer warn or penalize for not being checked in.
- Same-day walk-in auto-assignment prefers checked-in eligible therapists by attendance queue. If no eligible checked-in therapist exists, scheduled availability is used and the operator sees: `No staff has checked in yet. Showing scheduled availability. Confirm staff presence before starting service.`
- Manual same-day walk-in booking also returns the same warning when the selected scheduled slot is available but no eligible checked-in therapist exists for that time.
- QR scans no longer let stale `staff_devices.branch_id` override the scanned QR branch. If current staff branch matches the scanned QR branch, the device branch is repaired and the scan continues.
- Wrong-branch blocks remain correct when the current staff record belongs to another branch.

**Database:**
- Applied migration `20260709054954_attendance_device_branch_sync` through linked `supabase db query --file` because both wrapper and direct `db push` timed out before SQL execution.
- Recorded the migration row manually in `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations`.
- Live verification: migration row present, trigger `trg_staff_branch_sync_devices` present, active device/staff branch mismatch count is `0`.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm test --run tests/lib/attendance/branch-validation.test.ts tests/lib/assignments/recommendation-engine.test.ts`: PASS, 8 tests.
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS.
- `pnpm build`: PASS, Next.js 16.2.4, 106 routes.

## 2026-07-09 - Staff Onboarding Branch Safety (STAFF-ONBOARDING-BRANCH-SAFETY-001)

**Task:** Harden the staff onboarding and approval flow so applicants cannot register under the wrong branch and approvers cannot silently assign them to a different branch.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/staff-onboarding/onboarding-form.tsx` — required branch selection/confirmation, branch cards, review branch display, password reminder, updated success copy.
- `src/app/staff-onboarding/actions.ts` — removed first-branch fallback, added branch validation, duplicate checks, branch confirmation metadata, approval branch-change metadata.
- `src/components/features/staff-onboarding/onboarding-review-list.tsx` — default approval branch from `requested_branch_id`, CRM branch selector lock, branch-change warning.
- `src/lib/staff/onboarding-validation.ts` — new pure helpers for branch validation, metadata building, and duplicate evaluation.
- `tests/lib/staff/onboarding-branch-validation.test.ts` — new.
- `tests/lib/staff/onboarding-duplicate-check.test.ts` — new.
- `tests/lib/staff/approval-branch-safety.test.ts` — new.
- `tests/components/staff-onboarding/onboarding-review-branch.test.tsx` — new.

**Behavior:**
- Applicants must select an active branch and confirm it; "No preference" is removed.
- Single-branch setups auto-select the branch but still show it to the applicant.
- Multi-branch setups show branch cards for the active branches.
- Review step displays the selected branch name.
- Server rejects missing or inactive branches and never falls back to the first branch.
- `staff.branch_id` and `staff_onboarding_requests.requested_branch_id` are kept in sync on submission and approval.
- Duplicate checks block submissions when the email exists in `auth.users` or submitted onboarding requests, or when the phone exists in active staff or submitted requests (including full-name + phone matches).
- CRM/CSR cannot approve into another branch; owner/manager branch changes are allowed but warned and recorded in request metadata.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS
- `pnpm lint`: PASS
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 107 routes
- `pnpm test --run`: PASS, 73 files / 623 tests

**Follow-up:**
- Authenticated browser QA of the onboarding form and CRM staff applications review list is still needed.

## 2026-07-09 - Codex (BRANCH-CORRECTION-REQUESTS-001 - QR Wrong Branch Correction Request Flow)

**Task:** Check whether the QR Attendance wrong-branch correction request flow existed, then complete the missing request/review/audit/UI pieces.

**Files Changed:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260709083908_staff_branch_audit_logs.sql` - added branch audit table, missing request indexes, active-branch validation, approval audit logging, and hardened review RPC.
- `src/lib/staff/branch-correction.ts` - added secure create/review/cancel helpers, device-cookie staff verification, duplicate-pending handling, inbox mapping, and staff-friendly success/error copy.
- `src/lib/staff/branch-correction-policy.ts` and `src/lib/staff/branch-correction-types.ts` - centralized owner/manager/CRM/staff rules and expanded scan/inbox types.
- `src/lib/attendance/scan-engine.ts` and `src/lib/attendance/types.ts` - surfaced wrong-branch correction payloads, pending-request state, device context, and rich wrong-branch scan metadata.
- `src/app/scan/actions.ts` and `src/app/api/attendance/public-scan/route.ts` - added create/cancel request actions and preserved branch-correction data in public scan responses.
- `src/components/features/attendance/public-scan-processor.tsx`, `public-scan-result.tsx`, and `public-scan-processor.module.css` - made wrong-branch scan results actionable, duplicate-safe, and able to clear context for another account.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/staff/actions.ts`, `page.tsx`, `src/components/features/crm/staff/crm-staff-workspace.tsx`, and `crm-staff-branch-corrections-tab.tsx` - added requested-branch-scoped CRM review inbox and approve/reject actions.
- `tests/lib/staff/branch-correction-policy.test.ts`, `tests/lib/staff/branch-correction-migrations.test.ts`, `tests/components/attendance/public-scan-branch-correction.test.tsx`, and `tests/components/crm/crm-staff-branch-corrections-tab.test.tsx` - added focused coverage.

**Behavior:**
- Wrong-branch QR scans now show current staff profile branch, scanned QR branch, correction request action, pending-request state, and the front-desk approval reminder.
- Staff can submit correction requests only from an authenticated staff session or trusted wrong-branch scan device context; staff cannot update their own branch or approve their own request.
- CRM/CSR/front desk aliases can see/review only requests whose `requested_branch_id` equals their branch; owner/manager roles can review all.
- Approval updates `staff.branch_id` through the secure review RPC, writes `staff_branch_audit_logs`, and relies on the existing `staff_devices` branch-sync trigger for active devices.
- Wrong-branch scan events now carry QR/staff/branch/device/pending-request metadata for future diagnostics.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm test --run tests/lib/staff/branch-correction-policy.test.ts tests/lib/staff/branch-correction-migrations.test.ts tests/components/attendance/public-scan-branch-correction.test.tsx tests/components/crm/crm-staff-branch-corrections-tab.test.tsx tests/lib/attendance/branch-validation.test.ts`: PASS, 16 tests.
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS.
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 106 routes.

**Follow-up:**
- Apply pending Supabase migrations and regenerate database types if required by the deployment workflow.
- Run authenticated CRM/front-desk browser QA and physical QR phone scan QA after the migrations are live.

## 2026-07-09 - Codex (CRM-BOOKING-HOME-SERVICE-DISTANCE-001 - CRM Availability and Home Service Distance)

**Task:** Finish the CRM/internal booking fix so saved schedules drive therapist availability, Home Service addresses use live search, and CRM computes/stores travel distance and fee.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/bookings/quick-booking-form.tsx` - switched pre-submit availability checks to `/api/booking/crm-availability`, reused the public Places autocomplete for CRM Home Service, required a selected geocoded address, added live distance/travel-fee summary, and submitted address/coordinate/distance metadata.
- `src/lib/actions/inhouse-booking.ts` - replaced the remaining generic no-therapist error copy with the schedule-specific CRM message while preserving the existing distance quote/metadata storage path.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/spaces-rules/page.tsx` - added fallback defaults for Home Service free-km and extra-km fee settings.
- `tests/lib/home-service/distance-fee.test.ts` - added pure travel-fee and distance boundary coverage.

**Behavior:**
- CRM quick booking now uses the CRM availability endpoint instead of the generic public slots endpoint.
- Saved schedules and staff service assignment are the source of truth; attendance/check-in is not a hard blocker.
- Same-day walk-in contexts can warn: `No therapist has clocked in yet, but scheduled staff are available.`
- CRM Home Service requires a selected Google Places result, calculates branch-to-customer distance server-side, and shows subtotal, distance, free allowance, charged km, travel fee, and total before save.
- Travel fee policy is first 5 km free, then PHP 100 per started extra km.
- Server quotes use Google driving distance when `GOOGLE_MAPS_SERVER_API_KEY` is present and Haversine fallback otherwise.
- Public booking wizard behavior was preserved.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS.
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 108 routes.
- `pnpm test --run tests/lib/assignments/recommendation-engine.test.ts tests/lib/home-service/distance-fee.test.ts`: PASS, 2 files / 18 tests.

**Follow-up:**
- Apply pending Supabase migrations and regenerate database types if required by the deployment workflow.
- Configure `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_BROWSER_KEY` for browser autocomplete and `GOOGLE_MAPS_SERVER_API_KEY` for driving distance quotes.
- Run authenticated CRM browser QA with real Places/distance credentials.

---

## 2026-07-09 - Codex (CRM-HOME-SERVICE-LOCATION-FIELD-CLEANUP-001)

**Task:** Remove redundant CRM Home Service location fields and make the selected Google Places service address the single source of truth.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/bookings/quick-booking-form.tsx` - removed visible city/barangay/landmark/location-note inputs, kept one required Places-backed `Service address`, added optional `Access note / special direction`, and updated the summary labels/order.
- `src/lib/actions/inhouse-booking.ts` - stores the optional note as `home_service_access_note` and persists address components plus distance/source/travel-fee details in Home Service metadata.
- `src/lib/validations/booking.ts` - added `homeServiceAccessNote` to the CRM in-house booking schema.

**Behavior:**
- Staff must select a valid Google Places result before CRM Home Service distance can be calculated.
- City and barangay are auto-derived from Google address components when available and are no longer manually edited in CRM.
- The optional access note does not affect distance calculation.
- Public booking wizard behavior was not changed.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm test --run tests/lib/home-service/distance-fee.test.ts`: PASS, 14 tests.
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS.
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 108 routes.

---

## 2026-07-09 - Codex (BRANCH-LOCATION-HOME-SERVICE-ORIGIN-001)

**Task:** Add editable branch location settings so CRM Home Service distance can use the selected branch coordinates as the origin.

**Discovery:**
- Branch edit UI/action are `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/branches/[branchId]/branch-edit-form.tsx` and `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/branches/actions.ts`.
- `branches` already had `address`, `maps_embed_url`, `latitude`, and `longitude`.
- `branch_booking_rules` already had `home_service_free_km` and `home_service_extra_km_fee`.
- CRM Home Service distance already reads branch coordinates in `src/lib/home-service/distance-service.ts`.
- Shared Places autocomplete lives at `src/components/public/places-autocomplete.tsx`.

**Files Changed:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260709114038_branch_location_settings.sql` - adds branch `place_id`, `city`, `barangay`, and `location_metadata`.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/branches/[branchId]/branch-edit-form.tsx` - replaces plain address editing with a Places-backed branch service address origin editor.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/branches/actions.ts` - persists origin coordinates/place metadata.
- `src/lib/validations/branch.ts` - validates branch location payload and coordinate pairs.
- `src/lib/home-service/distance-service.ts` - clarifies missing branch-origin message.
- `src/types/supabase.ts` - updates local branch column types.
- `tests/lib/validations/branch-location.test.ts` - adds focused validation coverage.

**Behavior:**
- Owner branch details can now save the selected branch service address with latitude/longitude.
- City/barangay are derived from Google address components when available.
- CRM Home Service distance continues to use selected branch coordinates as origin and customer Places coordinates as destination.
- Public booking wizard behavior was not changed.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm test --run tests/lib/validations/branch-location.test.ts tests/lib/home-service/distance-fee.test.ts`: PASS, 16 tests.
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS.
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 108 routes.

**Follow-up:**
- Apply pending Supabase migrations and run authenticated owner branch-detail plus CRM Home Service quote QA with real Google Places selection.

## 2026-07-09 - Codex (SCHEDULE-CONFLICT-CLARITY-001)

**Task:** Make the live Schedule Daily Timeline / Coverage Overview conflict count clear, clickable, and actionable for front desk staff without changing booking, attendance, QR, or schedule setup write behavior.

**Discovery / Root Cause:**
- The visible `Conflicts` count was calculated in `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/daily-timeline-coverage-card.tsx` by counting `DailyTimelineAlert` items with `resource_conflict` or `staff_conflict`.
- That count was too narrow and count-only: it did not expose who/what/time/rule/fix details, and it was separate from the broader schedule safety cases operators need to understand.

**Files Added:**
- `src/lib/schedule/live-schedule-conflict-types.ts`
- `src/lib/schedule/live-schedule-conflicts.ts`
- `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/daily-timeline-conflict-details-panel.tsx`
- `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/daily-timeline-conflict-actions.ts`
- `tests/lib/schedule/live-schedule-conflicts.test.ts`
- `tests/lib/schedule/daily-timeline-conflict-details-panel.test.tsx`

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/schedule/page.tsx`
- `src/app/api/crm/schedule/route.ts`
- `src/components/features/schedule/hooks/use-live-daily-schedule.ts`
- `src/components/features/schedule/workspace/schedule-workspace-shell.tsx`
- `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/daily-timeline-tab.tsx`

- `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/daily-timeline-board.tsx`
- `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/daily-timeline-staff-row.tsx`
- `tests/lib/schedule/daily-timeline-coverage-card.test.tsx`

**Behavior:**
- Daily Timeline and Coverage Overview now use one central `LiveScheduleConflict` list.
- The conflict count opens a `Conflict Details` panel with one card per conflict, plain-language operator copy, severity, affected staff/bookings/room/time, rule/fix guidance, and dev-only debug metadata.
- Timeline staff rows and booking blocks now show warning/critical conflict indicators.
- Quick actions are safe and guided: select affected staff/bookings, open Schedule Setup, open Full Schedule, or open the existing availability review path.
- Detected conflict types include staff overlap, room double-booking, missing room, booking outside shift, booking on day off, booking during blocked time, missing schedule, duplicate schedule window, Home Service travel-buffer warning, and coverage gap.
- Attendance/check-in remains live operational status only; no `staff not clocked in` schedule conflict was introduced.
- Public/online booking, CRM booking availability, QR attendance, and schedule setup write behavior were preserved.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS.
- `pnpm build`: PASS, Next.js 16.2.4, 108 routes.
- `pnpm test --run tests/lib/schedule/live-schedule-conflicts.test.ts tests/lib/schedule/daily-timeline-conflict-details-panel.test.tsx tests/lib/schedule/daily-timeline-coverage-card.test.tsx tests/lib/schedule/daily-timeline-operations.test.ts`: PASS, 4 files / 15 tests.

**Follow-up:**
- Run authenticated CRM browser QA against live branch data to confirm operator flow and copy in the real workspace.

---

## 2026-07-09 - Codex (SCHEDULE-CONFLICT-CENTER-001)

**Task:** Replace the redundant right-rail Conflict Details card with a centralized Schedule Conflict Center modal launched from Coverage Overview.

**Discovery / Root Cause:**
- The conflict system itself was already working, but the UI rendered two conflict surfaces in the right rail: Coverage Overview plus a separate expanded details card.
- Large conflict batches made the Schedule workspace too tall because details were rendered inline instead of in a bounded modal.

**Files Added:**
- `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/schedule-conflict-center-dialog.tsx`
- `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/schedule-conflict-category-tabs.tsx`
- `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/schedule-conflict-summary-list.tsx`
- `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/schedule-conflict-issue-card.tsx`
- `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/schedule-conflict-action-panel.tsx`
- `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/schedule-conflict-center-model.ts`
- `tests/lib/schedule/schedule-conflict-center-dialog.test.tsx`

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/daily-timeline-coverage-card.tsx` - now shows All clear / Schedule issues states and opens the modal via `Review Issues`.
- `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/daily-timeline-operations-rail.tsx` - no longer renders an inline conflict details card.
- `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/daily-timeline-tab.tsx` - owns the modal open state and mounts `ScheduleConflictCenterDialog`.
- `src/components/shared/overlays/admin-dialog.tsx` - adds an optional accessible label prop for named modal dialogs.
- `tests/lib/schedule/daily-timeline-coverage-card.test.tsx` - covers the single Coverage Overview entry point.

**Behavior:**
- Coverage Overview is now the only conflict entry point in the right rail.
- The modal filters conflicts by All, Critical, Staff, Rooms, Coverage, Travel, Blocked Time, and Schedule.
- Issue cards show human-friendly titles, affected staff/booking/time/resource context, broken rule, why it matters, recommended fix, and safe quick actions.
- Quick actions open an in-modal action preview and then delegate to the existing conflict action routing.
- Existing conflict detection, conflict count, timeline indicators, staff-row indicators, SWR refresh, public booking, CRM booking availability, QR attendance, and schedule setup write behavior were preserved.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm test --run tests/lib/schedule/live-schedule-conflicts.test.ts tests/lib/schedule/schedule-conflict-center-dialog.test.tsx tests/lib/schedule/daily-timeline-coverage-card.test.tsx tests/lib/schedule/daily-timeline-operations.test.ts`: PASS, 4 files / 17 tests.

- `pnpm type-check`: PASS.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS.
- `pnpm build`: PASS, Next.js 16.2.4, 108 routes.

**Follow-up:**
- Run authenticated CRM browser QA against live branch data for final visual/operator confirmation.

---

## 2026-07-09 - Codex (AGENT-COACH-IDLE-LOOP-001)

**Task:** Fix `Maximum update depth exceeded` runtime error in `AgentCoachProvider`.

**Root Cause:**
- The Agent Coach idle reset listener called `setIsIdle(false)` on every mousemove, keydown, click, and scroll event even when `isIdle` was already false.
- Scroll/activity bursts could repeatedly request identical React state updates and trip the nested-update guard in the CRM/Owner provider tree.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/agent/agent-context-provider.tsx` - added ref-backed idle state and timeout guards so only real idle-state changes call `setIsIdle`.
- `tests/components/agent/agent-context-provider.test.tsx` - adds a regression test for repeated activity events and the 45-second idle transition.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm test --run tests/components/agent/agent-context-provider.test.tsx`: PASS, 1 test.
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS.
- `pnpm build`: PASS, Next.js 16.2.4, 108 routes.

---

## 2026-07-09 - Codex (SCHEDULE-CONFLICT-RESOLUTION-CENTER-001)

**Task:** Finalize the Schedule Conflict Center impact-model cleanup and verification after the new dialog wiring landed.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/schedule-conflict-center-dialog.tsx` - removed the unused severity-count memo/import.
- `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/schedule-conflict-center-model.ts` - fixed stale coverage-tab typing and narrowed accepted/active issue status.
- `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/schedule-conflict-summary-list.tsx` - updated the helper to compile against impact groups and new tab keys.
- `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/schedule-conflict-resolution-panel.tsx` - added explicit React node and Lucide icon typing.
- `tests/lib/schedule/schedule-conflict-center-dialog.test.tsx` - refreshed dialog coverage for the reasoned accept-exception flow.

**Behavior:**
- Coverage-gap issues now remain in All/Audit instead of pointing at a removed Coverage tab.
- Approval-level issues can be accepted only with reason/scope/audit visibility and then move to Accepted.
- Must Fix issues still cannot be accepted, and no blind schedule writes were added.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS.
- Focused schedule tests: PASS, 12 files / 49 tests.
- Booking/availability safety tests: PASS, 8 files / 172 tests.
- `pnpm build`: PASS, Next.js 16.2.4, 108 routes.

**Follow-up:**
- Run authenticated CRM browser QA against live branch data for final visual/operator confirmation.

## 2026-07-10 - Codex (ATTENDANCE-RECOVERY-RULES-001)

**Task:** Upgrade Attendance with schedule-aware recovery, rules, audit, and closing-scan intent handling.

**Files Added:**
- `src/lib/attendance/attendance-intent-engine.ts` - pure Smart Attendance Intent Engine for schedule-aware scan classification.
- `src/lib/attendance/attendance-correction-service.ts` - server-only correction/rules service for Recovery actions and audit rows.
- `src/components/features/attendance/recovery/attendance-recovery-tab.tsx` - Recovery Center UI with Today Recovery, Staff Records, Rules, and Audit Log.
- `tests/lib/attendance/attendance-intent-engine.test.ts` - focused classifier coverage.
- `supabase/migrations/20260710040835_attendance_recovery_rules.sql` - attendance rules and correction audit migration.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/attendance/scan-engine.ts` - classifies intent before writing check-ins; first closing scans without active check-in now go to Recovery instead of becoming clock-ins.
- `src/lib/attendance/types.ts` and `src/lib/attendance/queries.ts` - expanded settings DTOs, record schedule fields, exception metadata, and audit feed.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/attendance/actions.ts` - added correction/rule server actions.
- `src/components/features/attendance/attendance-workspace.tsx` - mounts Recovery tab, refreshes audit/correction mutations, and listens to `attendance_corrections`.
- `src/components/features/attendance/attendance-header.tsx`, `attendance-tabs.tsx`, overview quick actions/attention panel, and records tab - updated visible entry points from Exceptions to Recovery.

**Behavior:**
- The internal attendance tab key remains `exceptions`; visible UI now labels it Recovery.
- QR attendance scans preserve device/branch validation and raw scan event logging.
- If a staff member's first scan is in a configured clock-out/closing window and there is no active check-in, the scan is recorded as an `exception` with reason `likely_closing_scan_without_clock_in`; no `staff_shift_checkins` row is inserted.
- Recovery Center can mark items reviewed, apply launch recovery from the saved scan/schedule evidence, manually clock out active records, reset a staff day, edit attendance rules, and view correction audit entries.
- Normal clock-in/out, room scan, service session, first-scan registration, duplicate debounce, and branch mismatch behavior are preserved.

## 2026-07-11 - Codex (CRM-PERFORMANCE-OPTIMIZATION-001)

**Task:** Complete the frozen CRM performance optimization program with evidence-backed, low-risk source optimizations.

**Files Added:**
- `docs/performance/crm-performance-baseline.md` - baseline verification, route/build artifact evidence, client manifest/source hotspot audit, findings, and deferred areas.
- `docs/performance/crm-performance-optimization-report.md` - implementation summary, verification, bundle outcome, and follow-up candidates.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/crm/today/work-queue-dashboard.tsx` - memoized the Work Queue summary as a single pass over `queueData`.
- `src/components/features/crm/today/work-queue-panel.tsx` - replaced repeated filter-count scans with one memoized counter pass and memoized visible rows.
- `src/components/features/bookings/bookings-workspace.tsx` - made initial tab derivation lazy and memoized tab counts/current visible rows.
- `src/components/features/dispatch/dispatch-live-map-tab.tsx` - stabilized the map marker selection callback passed to `MapCanvas`.
- `.context/CURRENT_TASK.cmd.md`, `.context/CHANGELOG.cmd.md`, `.context/HANDOFF.cmd.md`, `.context/DECISIONS.cmd.md`, `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, and `docs/ROADMAP.md` - logged the completed performance pass.

**Behavior:**
- No CRM UI, workflow, route, server action, schema, RLS, permission, payment, booking lifecycle, dispatch guard, or cache semantics were changed.
- Today and Bookings now avoid repeated derived-list work on unrelated local UI renders.
- Dispatch map selection no longer changes the `MapCanvas` effect dependency solely because selected booking state changed.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS.
- `pnpm test -- --run --testTimeout=10000`: PASS, 83 files / 674 tests.
- `pnpm build`: PASS, Next.js 16.2.4, 108 app routes.

**Follow-up:**
- Bookings remains NOT CERTIFIED until authenticated browser interaction QA is completed.
- Bundle splitting, query column narrowing, and database/index work should wait for a separately certified performance phase.

## 2026-07-12 - Codex (ATTENDANCE-AUTONOMY-HARDENING-001)

**Task:** Perform the final local Attendance hardening pass while preserving the schedule-first scan alignment and selected-record reset work already present in the repository.

**Files Added:**
- `src/lib/attendance/shift-instance.ts` - branch-local business time and stable Attendance shift-instance model.
- `src/lib/attendance/attendance-state-machine.ts` - current Attendance state and next expected scan action resolver.
- `tests/lib/attendance/shift-instance.test.ts` - timezone, business-day, source, and stable key coverage.
- `tests/lib/attendance/attendance-state-machine.test.ts` - next-action/state coverage.
- `supabase/migrations/20260712035222_attendance_autonomy_hardening.sql` - immutable schedule snapshots, scan idempotency metadata, deduped Recovery fields, and device policy metadata.
- `docs/maintenance/attendance-operations-runbook.md` - operations runbook for device connection, recovery, replacement, Test Mode, Recovery, reconciliation, migration verification, and troubleshooting.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/attendance/scan-engine.ts` - captures shift-instance snapshots, uses branch timezone/business date, dedupes Recovery cases, records operation ids/results, and scopes operational revalidation.
- `src/lib/attendance/attendance-intent-engine.ts` - carries branch timezone into schedule window conversion and exposes shift-instance key on current open sessions.
- `src/lib/attendance/time.ts` - supports configured IANA timezone conversion while keeping Manila as the default.
- `src/lib/attendance/attendance-correction-service.ts` - fails loudly on failed correction/audit substeps and returns the actual post-reset next action.
- `src/lib/attendance/device-registry.ts` - loads staff first and devices by staff id, avoiding stale branch metadata and broad scan-event history reads.
- `src/lib/attendance/device-registry-status.ts`, `src/lib/attendance/types.ts` - recognize expanded device statuses.
- `src/lib/attendance/queries.ts`, `src/app/scan/actions.ts` - narrow route revalidation to Attendance-first surfaces unless operational readiness actually changed.
- `src/lib/attendance/tokens.ts` - requires `ATTENDANCE_DEVICE_SECRET` in production and limits fallback to explicit local development.
- `src/types/supabase.ts` - regenerated/reconciled linked types for pending local schema columns.
- Project context/docs files - recorded architecture, blockers, and runbook.

**Behavior:**
- Every normal clock-in now captures an immutable shift snapshot: shift-instance key, schedule source, source id, branch timezone, business date, and scheduled start/end.
- Duplicate/completed checks prefer the stable `shift_instance_key` instead of only `shift_date` plus `shift_type`.
- Branch timezone and attendance day boundary drive current business date and schedule timestamp conversion.
- Repeated scan retries with the same request id can replay the committed public scan result from `qr_scan_events.operation_result`.
- Active Recovery issues are deduped by branch/staff/shift/reason context with occurrence counters and latest-scan linkage.
- Device Registry is staff-first and no longer loads thousands of raw `qr_scan_events` to compute its table.
- Production device-cookie hashing now fails closed without `ATTENDANCE_DEVICE_SECRET`.

**Verification:**
- `npx vitest run tests/lib/attendance/attendance-intent-engine.test.ts tests/lib/attendance/shift-instance.test.ts tests/lib/attendance/attendance-state-machine.test.ts tests/lib/attendance/device-recovery.test.ts`: PASS, 4 files / 27 tests.
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS.
- `pnpm test`: PASS, 87 files / 696 tests.
- `pnpm build`: PASS, Next.js 16.2.4, 108 routes.
- `pnpm db:types`: PASS, followed by local type reconciliation because the linked remote schema is behind pending migrations.
- `.\node_modules\.bin\supabase.CMD migration list --local`: BLOCKED, local Postgres at `127.0.0.1:54322` refused the connection.
- `pnpm db:status`: BLOCKED, linked migration-history read timed out to `aws-1-ap-northeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432`; output included `Remote schema changed: no`.
- `pnpm db:doctor`: BLOCKED, CLI/link/token/pooler checks passed, migration-history read timed out.

**Follow-up:**
- Apply/verify the two pending Attendance migrations from a working Supabase DB path and regenerate types against the updated schema.
- Replace app-level idempotent replay with a true transactional PostgreSQL RPC for scan persistence.
- Move all multi-step correction operations into transactional RPCs.
- Complete and QA account claim, OTP/rate-limit controls, canonical scan host redirects, rotating branch challenge, scheduled reconciliation, and the full diagnostic modal.
- Run authenticated CRM QA, Owner QA, and physical phone/device-cookie QA before declaring Attendance production-closed.

---

## 2026-07-12 - Codex (ATTENDANCE-AUTONOMY-HARDENING-001 Continuation)

**Task:** Continue the Attendance autonomy hardening pass by closing the highest-risk transactional gaps that were still explicitly open.

**Files Added:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260712044527_attendance_transactional_scan_rpc.sql` - transactional interpreted scan commit RPC.
- `supabase/migrations/20260712045429_attendance_transactional_corrections_rpc.sql` - transactional selected-record reset correction RPC.
- `tests/lib/attendance/transactional-scan-rpc-migration.test.ts` - migration contract checks for locking, idempotency, and service-role-only execution.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/attendance/scan-engine.ts` - routes normal interpreted clock-in, clock-out, active-service-blocked, and Recovery-intent Attendance commits through `commit_attendance_scan_transaction`.
- `src/lib/attendance/attendance-correction-service.ts` - routes selected-record Attendance State Reset through `reset_attendance_state_transaction`.
- `src/types/supabase.ts` - reconciles generated types for the two new RPCs.
- `.context/*`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, and `docs/maintenance/attendance-operations-runbook.md` - records the continuation, live DB evidence, and remaining blockers.

**Database Evidence:**
- Both new RPC definitions were applied to the linked database via `supabase db query --linked --dns-resolver https --file ...`.
- Catalog verification confirmed both RPCs exist and are `security invoker`.
- Routine privilege verification showed EXECUTE only for `postgres` and `service_role`.
- No-mutation probes returned `invalid_request` rows.
- Migration history remains unreconciled: `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` returned `0` rows for `20260710040835`, `20260710055131`, `20260712000100`, `20260712035222`, `20260712044527`, and `20260712045429`.

**Verification:**
- Focused Attendance tests: PASS, 5 files / 30 tests.
- `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false`: PASS.
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS.
- `pnpm test`: PASS, 88 files / 699 tests.
- `pnpm build`: PASS, Next.js 16.2.4, 108 routes.

**Follow-up:**
- Reconcile Supabase migration history from a working migration-history connection.
- Add transactional RPC coverage for manual clock-out, launch recovery, ignore-scan, rule updates, archive-test-data, and future rebuild/manual-attendance actions.
- Complete account claim/OTP/rate limits, canonical scan host, rotating challenge, scheduled reconciliation, diagnostic tooling, authenticated CRM/Owner QA, and real-device QA.

## 2026-07-12 - Codex (ATTENDANCE-HYDRATION-NOWMS-001)

**Task:** Fix CRM/Owner Attendance hydration mismatch in live worked-time labels.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/attendance/types.ts` - added serialized `serverNowMs` to `AttendanceWorkspaceData`.
- `src/lib/attendance/queries.ts` - captures one server timestamp snapshot while building Attendance workspace data.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/attendance/page.tsx` and `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/attendance/page.tsx` - pass `data.serverNowMs` into `AttendanceWorkspace`.
- `src/components/features/attendance/attendance-workspace.tsx` - requires `initialNowMs` and uses it for the initial client state before the post-hydration interval takes over.

**Behavior:**
- The initial SSR and client hydration render use the same timestamp for relative worked-time labels such as `94h 42m`.
- The live clock still refreshes after hydration through the existing 30-second interval.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS.
- `pnpm build`: PASS, Next.js 16.2.4, 108 routes.

---

## 2026-07-12 - Codex (SCHEDULE-DATA-OPTIMIZATION-001)

**Task:** Complete the resumed Schedule Setup and scheduling-data optimization pass from partial local edits.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/schedule/resolve-staff-schedule.ts` - adds explicit schedule statuses and conflict metadata, treats malformed overrides as authoritative conflicts, and returns empty operational windows for conflicts.
- `src/lib/schedule/staff-schedule-write.ts` - centralizes full-week schedule/group-rule row builders, split-shift validation, stale-row deactivation matrices, and content-level save verification.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/staff-availability/actions.ts` and `src/lib/actions/crm-schedule-availability.ts` - route individual weekly saves through complete matrix builders.
- `src/lib/actions/staff-schedule-groups.ts` - adds one-call group-rule save and complete apply-to-staff replacement with stale-row deactivation.
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/*` - adds explicit Split Shift UI and mutual-exclusion behavior for ordinary shift choices.
- `src/lib/queries/schedule.ts`, `src/lib/queries/crm-availability.ts`, `src/lib/queries/crm-readiness.ts`, `src/lib/schedule/live-schedule-conflicts.ts`, and `src/lib/assignments/recommendation-engine.ts` - propagate conflict status so unsafe schedules are visible but blocked from availability/recommendations.
- Focused schedule/action/recommendation/CRM availability tests updated or added.

**Verification:**
- Focused scheduling slice: PASS, 8 files / 52 tests.
- `npm run type-check`: PASS.
- `npm run lint`: PASS.
- `npx vitest run`: PASS, 88 files / 707 tests.
- `npm run build`: PASS, Next.js 16.2.4, 108 routes.

## 2026-07-13 - Codex (CRADLE-BACKEND-STABILIZATION-AND-SCHEDULE-REPAIR-001)

**Task:** Continue the backend stabilization and Schedule Setup hardening pass by moving weekly schedule saves toward transactional database replacement, adding deterministic repair SQL, and filtering non-operational duplicate/test staff from availability.

**Files Added:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260712165012_backend_stabilization_schedule_repair.sql` - idempotent schedule/data repair migration with backups, operational staff helpers, booking-rule fee columns, schedule overlap validation triggers, and transactional weekly replacement RPCs.
- `src/lib/staff/operational-staff.ts` - shared metadata/archive/merge-aware operational staff predicate.
- `tests/lib/staff/operational-staff.test.ts` - focused operational staff filtering coverage.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/staff-availability/actions.ts` - individual weekly schedule saves call `replace_staff_weekly_schedule(...)` and verify returned rows.
- `src/lib/actions/staff-schedule-groups.ts` - group weekly schedule saves call `replace_group_weekly_schedule(...)` and verify returned rows.
- `src/lib/engine/availability.ts` - provider selection excludes inactive, archived, merged, test, and non-schedulable staff.
- `src/components/features/crm/services/crm-services-workspace.tsx` - fallback staff adapter includes archive/merge identity fields from the live schema.
- `src/types/supabase.ts` - regenerated from the linked schema and reconciled for pending local booking-rule fee columns.
- `tests/lib/actions/staff-schedule-groups.test.ts` - updated to assert the new group schedule RPC contract.
- `.context/*`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` - record the implementation, live findings, verification, and remaining production apply blocker.

**Database Evidence:**
- Linked live probes found corrupted Main Spa `scheduling_rules` minimums, duplicate unmerged staff identities, empty `staff_duty_assignments`, stale older `single` rows superseded by newer opening/closing rows, overlapping group default templates, and missing `branch_booking_rules.home_service_*` columns that code already expects.
- The new migration was dry-run executed inside `BEGIN; ... ROLLBACK;` against the linked database through `supabase db query --linked --dns-resolver https`; it completed successfully without committing changes.
- The migration was not applied to production from this environment because linked migration-history reads still time out on port 5432 and remote migration history is known to be behind live schema effects.

**Verification:**
- Focused scheduling/action/staff tests: PASS, 4 files / 31 tests.
- `pnpm db:types`: PASS, followed by local pending-column reconciliation.
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS.
- `pnpm test`: PASS, 89 files / 710 tests.
- `pnpm build`: PASS, Next.js 16.2.4, 108 routes.

**Follow-up:**
- Apply `20260712165012_backend_stabilization_schedule_repair.sql` from a working Supabase migration-history path, then rerun type generation and all app checks.
- Resolve ambiguous Nikki active opening/closing overlaps manually after business confirmation.
- Move manual staff schedule import and group apply-to-staff replacement onto transactional RPC paths.
- Complete the broader duplicate staff merge/identity cleanup after reviewing bookings, attendance, payroll, and Auth ownership.

---

## 2026-07-13 - Codex (CRADLE-SCHEDULE-UPDATE-INTEGRATION-REPAIR-006)

**Task:** Repair CRM staff schedule update failures that surfaced as the generic "We could not update this schedule. Please try again." message.

**Root Cause:**
- The Adjust Schedule and Schedule Setup weekly save actions called `public.replace_staff_weekly_schedule(uuid, uuid, jsonb)`, but the linked live database did not have that RPC.
- The live `staff_schedules` table still had `staff_schedules_staff_day_shift_unique`, so ordered split windows were not the enforced database identity.
- Live data also contained legacy inactive placeholder rows from the old shift-type matrix contract.

**Files Added:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260713035024_schedule_update_integration_repair.sql` - idempotent corrective migration for ordered-window constraints, helper functions, trigger, RPC, stale inactive cleanup with backups, and PostgREST schema reload.
- `src/lib/actions/schedule-mutation-errors.ts` - shared schedule mutation classifier for `MIGRATION_REQUIRED`, `RLS_DENIED`, `OVERLAPPING_WINDOWS`, `INVALID_OVERNIGHT_WINDOW`, `INVALID_SHIFT_TYPE`, and generic fallback.
- `tests/lib/actions/schedule-mutation-errors.test.ts` - regression coverage for missing RPC/stale constraint/RLS/overlap classification.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/actions/crm-schedule-availability.ts` and `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/staff-availability/actions.ts` - weekly saves now return structured safe error codes and operation ids while preserving `error` for existing UI.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/staff/actions.ts` - removed direct old-conflict `staff_schedules` upsert; single-day manager saves now replace the full staff week through `replace_staff_weekly_schedule`.
- `src/lib/schedule/staff-schedule-write.ts` and Adjust Schedule utilities/editor - added the 12-window per weekday contract and UI guard.
- Resolver consumers in booking availability, assignment recommendations, resolved schedule queries, owner dashboard, staff schedule reads, CRM full schedule, and schedule suggestions now select/use `window_order` and `ends_next_day` where needed.
- `tests/lib/schedule/adjust-schedule-dialog.test.tsx` and `tests/lib/schedule/staff-schedule-write.test.ts` - added actionable save-error and window-ceiling coverage.
- Context/docs updated with live findings, migration apply path, verification, and remaining migration-history blocker.

**Live Database Evidence:**
- Applied `20260713035024_schedule_update_integration_repair.sql` through `supabase db query --linked --dns-resolver https --file ...` because the normal direct Postgres migration-history path timed out.
- Live catalog now shows `staff_schedules_staff_day_window_unique`, no `staff_schedules_staff_day_shift_unique`, `window_order` check `1..12`, `validate_staff_schedule_window_trigger`, and `replace_staff_weekly_schedule(uuid,uuid,jsonb)`.
- PostgREST RPC probe with fake IDs returned business validation `23514`, proving the function is visible to the app-facing API.
- Rollbacked live RPC round-trip using a real staff member's current rows returned 7 rows and committed no schedule changes.
- Live data probes show zero duplicate staff/day/window keys and zero invalid inactive placeholder rows.

**Verification:**
- Focused tests: PASS, 5 files / 38 tests.
- `pnpm db:types`: PASS after live corrective migration.
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: PASS.
- Live schema/RPC probes: PASS.
- `pnpm build`: PASS, Next.js 16.2.4, 108 routes.

**Remaining Blocker:**
- `pnpm db:push --dry-run` and `pnpm db:status` still time out against `aws-1-ap-northeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432`, including escalated retries. Live schema is repaired, but linked migration history is not certified from this environment.

---

## 2026-07-13 - Codex (CRADLE-SCHEDULE-SYSTEM-UNIFICATION-007)

**Task:** Finish unifying runtime scheduling around CRM-controlled individual schedules without redesigning Daily Timeline or reintroducing group fallback.

**Files Added:**
- `src/lib/schedule/schedule-domain.ts` - shared UI/DB shift adapter for `regular <-> single` plus Opening/Regular/Closing labels.
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/individual-schedule-window-editor.tsx` - Schedule Setup weekly editor using the same Adjust Schedule draft, validation, preview, and `updateCrmStaffWeeklyWindowScheduleAction` save path.
- `supabase/migrations/20260713064332_schedule_realtime_publication.sql` - idempotent realtime publication repair for the schedule runtime tables.
- `tests/lib/schedule/schedule-domain.test.ts` and `tests/lib/staff-portal/week.test.ts` - adapter and staff-portal split/day-off regressions.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/queries/schedule.ts` - Daily Timeline now starts from the operational branch roster and joins bookings, blocked times, overrides, staff check-ins, and resolved individual schedules directly.
- `src/lib/schedule/resolve-staff-schedule.ts` and `src/lib/queries/resolved-staff-schedules.ts` - added `STAFF_NOT_OPERATIONAL`, override ids, and operational flags.
- `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/*` - preserved Daily Timeline layout while distinguishing Day Off, Not Configured, and Needs Review; added shift-aware colors, split-window filtering, attendance presence, and overnight block rendering.
- `src/lib/utils/schedule-timeline.ts` - timeline ranges and block widths now support overnight windows past midnight.
- `src/lib/schedule/live-schedule-conflicts.ts` - missing schedule is no longer emitted as a live conflict.
- `src/lib/staff-portal/week.ts` - grouped same-day schedule rows and resolved staff portal week days through the shared resolver.
- `src/components/features/schedule/hooks/use-schedule-realtime.ts` - subscribed to `staff_shift_checkins`.
- `src/components/features/schedule-adjustment/*` and `src/lib/actions/crm-schedule-availability.ts` - shared shift adapter usage so UI never persists/display-leaks `single`.

**Live Database Evidence:**
- Applied `20260713064332_schedule_realtime_publication.sql` with `supabase db query --linked --dns-resolver https --file ...`.
- Verified `supabase_realtime` includes `staff`, `staff_schedules`, `schedule_overrides`, `blocked_times`, `staff_shift_checkins`, `bookings`, and `branch_resources`.

**Verification:**
- Focused tests: PASS, 8 files / 41 tests.
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: PASS.
- `pnpm test`: PASS, 94 files / 731 tests.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS.
- `pnpm build`: PASS, Next.js 16.2.4, 108 routes.
- `git diff --check`: PASS, CRLF warnings only.

**Remaining Caveat:**
- Linked migration-history reads through the direct pooler path still need reconciliation. Live schema effects were verified via the Supabase Management API query path, but migration history is not certified from this environment.

---

## 2026-07-13 - Codex (CRADLE-SCHEDULE-LEFTOVER-CLEANUP-008)

**Task:** Clean leftover legacy schedule-health warnings after individual schedule unification without hiding genuine schedule issues.

**Files Added:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260713090000_schedule_leftover_cleanup.sql` - backed-up live data cleanup for corrupted Main Spa scheduling-rule minima and deterministic stale active `single` schedule rows.
- `tests/components/manager-today/manager-today-utils.test.ts` - Manager Today regression coverage for explicit room requirements.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/schedule/live-schedule-conflicts.ts` and `src/lib/schedule/live-schedule-conflict-types.ts` - added exact schedule issue conflict types/codes/fingerprints/source ids, explicit resource requirement detection, coverage requirement gating, resource-capacity-aware room overlap checks, and conflict dedupe.
- `src/lib/queries/schedule.ts` and `src/lib/queries/bookings.ts` - selected service metadata and resource details needed for explicit resource-requirement checks.
- `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/schedule-conflict-center-model.ts`, `schedule-conflict-issue-card.tsx`, and `schedule-conflict-resolution-panel.tsx` - display exact schedule issue labels and stop using the false `All day` fallback.
- `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/daily-timeline-alerts.ts`, `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-workspace.tsx`, `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-week-mode.tsx`, `src/components/features/spaces-rules/spaces-rules-utils.ts`, Manager Today, and mobile manager screens - missing-room warnings now require explicit service/resource metadata.
- `tests/lib/schedule/live-schedule-conflicts.test.ts` and `tests/lib/schedule/daily-timeline-operations.test.ts` - regressions for Dante invalid-window mapping, Angels no-room false positive, explicit room requirements, coverage gating, and fingerprints.
- `.context/*` and `docs/*` - recorded live evidence, warning contract, cleanup behavior, and verification.

**Live Database Evidence:**
- Dante/Boy (`a384447d-5e71-4ee2-809b-d91ef4cfe44b`) has active Mon-Sat `single` schedule rows `02:00-22:00`; resolver state is correctly `INVALID_TIME_WINDOW`.
- Angels Massage booking `1ea3ce31-6ead-49e0-9ff4-43501d5cf20d` has `resource_id=null`, `delivery_type=in_spa`, `service_metadata={}`, and no explicit resource requirement.
- Main Spa `scheduling_rules` had corrupted roster-total minima (`29/29/4/3/2`), which produced the false "Only 27 staff scheduled today" warning.
- Applied `20260713090000_schedule_leftover_cleanup.sql` through `supabase db query --linked --dns-resolver https --file ...`.
- Verified `schedule_repair_backups` contains 7 `leftover_cleanup_deactivate_stale_single_window` rows and 1 `leftover_cleanup_restore_corrupted_coverage_roster_totals` row; stale superseded active `single` rows are gone; Main Spa minima are now `1/1/1/0/0`.

**Behavior:**
- Genuine invalid schedule data now surfaces as exact issue types such as `schedule_invalid_time_window` with `INVALID_TIME_WINDOW`, exact time range, source ids, and stable fingerprint.
- Missing room/resource warnings require explicit service metadata (`requires_room`, `required_resource_type`, or equivalent); missing `resource_id` alone is not a warning.
- Coverage-gap conflicts require an explicit `coverageRequirement`; broad daily roster minima no longer generate live conflicts by themselves.
- Ambiguous schedule overlaps remain active for CRM review instead of being silently normalized.

**Verification:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: PASS.
- Focused tests: PASS, 5 files / 24 tests.
- `pnpm test --run`: PASS, 95 files / 735 tests.
- `pnpm lint`: PASS.
- `pnpm build`: PASS, Next.js 16.2.4, 108 routes.

**Remaining Caveat:**
- Linked Supabase migration-history reads through the direct pooler path still need reconciliation. Live effects were verified via linked SQL probes, but migration history is not certified from this environment.

## 2026-07-13 - Codex (CRADLE-ATTENDANCE-DIAGNOSTICS-AND-SCAN-REPAIR-009)

**Task:** Repair public Attendance QR scan failures that collapsed into generic Scan Interrupted while preserving security, individual schedule truth, and the atomic scan RPC.

**Files Added:**
- `src/lib/attendance/scan-errors.ts` - structured safe attendance scan error codes, operation IDs, DB/RPC classification, and server log helper.
- `src/lib/attendance/exception-codes.ts` - internal-to-stable Recovery exception mapping with metadata preservation.
- `supabase/migrations/20260713082146_attendance_scan_contract_repair.sql` - override `ends_next_day` column and explicit attendance schedule-source values.
- `tests/lib/attendance/exception-codes.test.ts` and `tests/app/attendance/public-scan-route.test.ts` - exception mapping and non-200 structured route failure coverage.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/api/attendance/public-scan/route.ts`, `src/app/scan/actions.ts`, and `src/components/features/attendance/public-scan-processor.tsx` - public scan failures now return/render structured safe JSON with operation IDs; unexpected backend failures are not returned as HTTP 200.
- `src/lib/attendance/scan-engine.ts` - generated DB typing, strict query/write error handling, stable exception persistence, RPC error classification, operation ID propagation, and typed check-in payloads.
- `src/lib/attendance/shift-instance.ts` and `tests/lib/attendance/shift-instance.test.ts` - schedule source values are `weekly | override | recovery | none`; split-shift identity includes window order/source row id; overnight uses authoritative `ends_next_day`.
- `src/lib/attendance/attendance-intent-engine.ts` - conflicting/non-operational schedule states go to explicit Recovery instead of being treated as valid windows.
- `src/lib/queries/resolved-staff-schedules.ts`, `src/lib/engine/availability.ts`, and `src/types/supabase.ts` - override `ends_next_day` support.
- Recovery UI helpers now read `metadata.internalExceptionType` so stable DB exception values still display precise operator labels.
- `.context/*` - recorded live evidence, root cause, decision, handoff, and verification.

**Live Database Evidence:**
- Before repair, live `attendance_exceptions.exception_type` allowed only stable values (`late`, `early_leave`, `overtime`, `missed_checkout`, `wrong_branch`, `unscheduled`, `duplicate_scan`, `active_service`, `unknown_device`, `revoked_device`, `resource_conflict`, `manual`), while scan events used internal reason codes.
- RPC `commit_attendance_scan_transaction` exists with service-role execute grant and RLS remains enabled on attendance/schedule tables.
- `supabase db push` timed out on the pooler; applied `20260713082146_attendance_scan_contract_repair.sql` idempotently via linked `db query` and inserted the migration record.
- Verified `schedule_overrides.ends_next_day` exists, `staff_shift_checkins.schedule_source` allows `weekly/override/recovery/none`, existing `weekly_schedule` rows migrated to `weekly`, and a no-mutation RPC probe returned `code=invalid_request`.

**Verification:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: PASS.
- Focused attendance tests: PASS, 5 files / 28 tests.
- `pnpm build`: PASS, Next.js 16.2.4, 108 routes.

**Remaining Caveat:**
- Physical phone scan QA was not certified in this session. Run registered-device live scans for clock-in, duplicate, clock-out, Recovery, and wrong-branch paths before declaring the operator workflow fully certified.
## 2026-07-13 - CRADLE-ATTENDANCE-DB-CONNECTION-AND-END-TO-END-DIAGNOSTICS-011

- Certified the local public scan path against linked Supabase with controlled
  blocked, recovery, clock-in, duplicate, clock-out, and exception outcomes.
- Added/applied `20260713120237_attendance_recovery_rpc_and_scan_realtime_repair.sql`
  for the recovery RPC ambiguity, atomic primary-device replacement ordering,
  and `qr_scan_events` Realtime publication.
- Fixed ambiguous booking-resource embeds that blocked clock-out after the
  schema gained a second `branch_resources` foreign key.
- Attendance Activity now includes safe failed/no-op attempts, handles missing
  staff, uses branch-local day boundaries, and refreshes on all attendance
  inserts.
- Fixed recovery expiry hydration mismatch and success-state replacement after
  cookie writes.
- Repaired `db:verify` so missing tables cannot pass through error-less HEAD
  responses and replaced stale table names with the live Attendance schema.
- Added safe Realtime probe tooling and Activity/timezone/recovery migration
  regression coverage.
- Full validation passes; direct pooler migration-history access remains timed
  out and an unrelated external Attendance-history deletion requires operator
  investigation.

## 2026-07-13 - ONLINE-STAFF-PREFERENCE-EXCEPTIONS-001

- Made `auto` the single explicit initial/reset value for the public staff
  preference while keeping ranked recommendations display-only.
- Expanded the public picker from schedule-valid staff only to all operational
  providers explicitly qualified for every selected service; schedule problems
  use neutral customer copy and remain selectable.
- Split manual-staff server validation into hard eligibility and soft schedule
  compatibility. Automatic assignment still uses the unchanged authoritative
  availability engine.
- Persisted open/resolved staff schedule exception state, stable reason codes,
  actor/time, reassignment details, and immutable resolution history in booking
  metadata without adding a booking status.
- Reused idempotent CRM notifications and workflow tasks, with amber warnings
  in Today, booking list/details, notifications, and prioritized work queue.
- Connected Keep selected staff and Mark resolved actions; existing reassignment
  and reschedule actions resolve and audit the review, while existing follow-up
  and schedule routes handle Contact customer and Open staff schedule.
- No migration or RLS change. Verification passed: focused 7 files / 25 tests,
  full Vitest 108 files / 780 tests, `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm
  build`, and public browser verification. Authenticated CRM browser QA remains
  blocked by `/login`.

## 2026-07-14 - CRM-BOOKINGS-DESKTOP-REDESIGN-001

- Rebuilt CRM Bookings desktop as a contained two-pane list and selected-booking
  command center while leaving mobile and manager/owner booking surfaces intact.
- Replaced permanent desktop workflow tabs with All bookings, Needs attention,
  and Active now quick filters; added exact status/source/location/payment/
  assignment filters, search, pagination, and legacy URL translation.
- Added focused list, header, summary, lifecycle, quick-action, tab, Overview,
  Activity, Details, service-session, and modal-stack components.
- Reused `getSelectedBookingActionPlan()`, existing server actions/modals,
  permission checks, staff recommendations, payment controls, follow-up copy,
  countdown, and auto-completion behavior.
- Activity uses selected-date booking timestamps plus existing follow-up,
  reschedule, and staff-exception metadata; no fabricated customer statistics or
  new audit subsystem was added.
- No migration or RLS change. Verification passed: focused 3 files / 9 tests,
  full Vitest 111 files / 789 tests, type-check, lint, build, and diff check.
  Authenticated browser comparison remains blocked by the local `/login` redirect.

## 2026-07-14 - CRM-BOOKING-ACTIONS-COMPACT-001

- Removed Booking Follow-up from routine CRM desktop actions. Confirmation,
  Call, Message, No Answer, and Confirm Later now run directly; Reschedule opens
  the existing reschedule modal; Cancel opens a focused reason-required dialog.
- Reworked the shared CRM booking action loader to start from the real booking
  UUID with a base-only select, then load primitive/related detail separately.
  Missing, wrong-branch, RLS/permission, database-load, final-state, and update
  failures now return specific errors with safe structured action logging.
- Cancellation keeps the existing `cancelled` state, actor/timestamp metadata,
  booking event path, staff notification cleanup, permissions, and refresh
  behavior while storing the selected reason and optional note.
- Reduced the desktop booking list to Time, Customer, and Status, added compact
  issue indicators, removed table horizontal scrolling, and changed the split
  to approximately 43% list / 57% selected-booking pane.
- No database migration, RLS policy, dependency, lifecycle, scheduling, payment,
  or mobile behavior changed.
- Verification passed: focused 6 files / 27 tests, full Vitest 114 files / 807
  tests, `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`, and `git diff --check`.
  Authenticated browser interaction remains blocked by the local `/login`
  redirect in the only available browser session.

## 2026-07-14 - ATTENDANCE-STAFF-SELF-SERVICE-001

- Repaired autonomous first-scan registration with a signed, expiring
  continuation, stable temporary phone identity, original-operation child ids,
  device policy/operational-staff checks, retry safety, and same-response
  attendance completion instead of a cookie reload.
- Added audited Staff Portal phone registration/replacement requests with CRM
  approval/rejection, same-phone activation, 24-hour single-use authorization,
  transactional replacement, notifications, workflow tasks, and Method 1
  reconciliation.
- Added the CRM Devices request-review panel, Staff Profile Attendance phone
  card, compact portal attendance summary, and self-only read-only
  `/staff-portal/attendance` history with staff-filtered Realtime refresh.
- Added focused table/RLS/RPC migration
  `20260714050554_attendance_staff_self_service.sql`, explicit Data API grants,
  generated TypeScript contracts, and regression tests.
- Verification passed: focused 6 files / 14 tests, full Vitest 119 files / 819
  tests, type-check, lint, and production build. Remote migration apply/history
  and authenticated physical-phone browser certification remain blocked by
  pooler timeout and the available browser's `/login` boundary.
## 2026-07-14 - ATTENDANCE-COMPLETE-SYSTEM-001 Phase 0 baseline

- Added the focused Attendance architecture map at
  `docs/attendance/PHASE_0_BASELINE_AND_ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md`.
- Recorded the actual routes, scan/schedule/device/recovery data paths,
  scheduler mechanisms, tables/RPCs/RLS contracts, hard limits, timezone
  hardcoding, and known incomplete surfaces.
- Baseline Attendance tests pass: 24 files / 96 tests.
- `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`, and `git diff --check` pass.
- Phase 1 is gated because linked migration-history access still times out, so
  deployed migrations, RPC grants, and RLS cannot be certified.
## 2026-07-14 - Attendance device-request schema-cache repair

- Confirmed the production error was caused by the absent
  `public.staff_device_registration_requests` table, not a stale client query.
- Applied `20260714050554_attendance_staff_self_service.sql` through the linked
  Supabase Management API SQL path after verifying all prerequisites.
- Reloaded PostgREST schema and verified live table visibility, RLS, three
  scoped SELECT policies, authenticated/service-role grants, and service-role-
  only review/completion RPC execution.
- Added the request table to `pnpm db:verify`; its service-role REST probe passes.
- Migration-history version reconciliation remains required because direct SQL
  application does not register the migration version.
## 2026-07-14 - ATTENDANCE-COMPLETE-SYSTEM-001 Phase 1

- Added the typed authoritative Attendance-day model composing canonical
  schedules, branch-local time, check-ins, sessions, and exceptions.
- CRM/Owner Attendance now loads the complete active branch roster into the
  shared model; Overview no longer labels every missing record Scheduled Today
  or truncates search/filter to 36 staff.
- Staff Portal now consumes the same resolved daily state while retaining
  self-only read access and history.
- Branch timezone drives the Phase 1 Overview/header/Staff Portal timestamp
  surfaces and device record navigation where workspace settings are present.
- Added 16 focused daily-model scenarios and documented the contract in
  `docs/attendance/PHASE_1_AUTHORITATIVE_DAILY_MODEL.md`.
- Verification passes: 25 focused files / 112 tests, 120 full-suite files / 835
  tests, type-check, lint, production build, and diff check.
## 2026-07-14 - ATTENDANCE-SCAN-RESOLUTION-001

- Added canonical typed scan resolutions and issue-specific mobile failure copy.
- Removed no-device roster incidents and grouped repeated blocked scan evidence.
- Separated Reviewed from Resolved and hid unrelated device actions.
- Added CRM Ask Staff, Staff Portal responses, and technical escalation through
  existing notification/task infrastructure.
- Applied and verified migration `20260714105907` with RLS and restricted grants.
- Type-check, lint, 121 files / 848 tests, and diff check pass.

## 2026-07-14 - ATTENDANCE-FLUID-OPERATIONS-001

- Replaced legacy schedule-match-first behavior with fixed record-first intent:
  a sole open row closes on the next valid scan; missing schedule, off-day, and
  ordinary outside-window scans record and flag; multiple opens and a first
  closing scan are captured without invented attendance.
- Added date-effective branch authority, staff-wide single-open concurrency guard,
  correction-to-exception linkage, atomic review correction RPC, and durable
  device lifecycle audit in migration `20260714143000`.
- Added the exact eight-state operational status to the shared day model and wired
  CRM Overview and Staff Portal consumers to it.
- Consolidated the operator surface as Attendance Review Queue, deprecated legacy
  blocking switches in behavior/UI, and preserved raw scans through every correction.
- Replaced twelve placeholder reports with exactly Daily Attendance, Exceptions
  and Corrections, and Payroll Export; filters and CSV now use row-level data and
  unresolved ambiguous minutes are not approved payable time.
- Added the 28-scenario evidence matrix, focused intent/day/report/migration tests,
  and implementation guide at `docs/attendance/FLUID_OPERATIONS.md`.
- Verification passes: cold type-check, lint, full suite at 123 files / 859 tests,
  production Next.js 16.2.4 build (109 static pages), and `git diff --check`.
  Authenticated/live migration QA status is recorded in the task handoff.

## 2026-07-14 - Codex (ATTENDANCE-CRM-CLOSING-POLICY-001)

**Task:** Integrate branch-level Attendance Rules and the CRM closing-shift
intervention policy into the existing Owner, Attendance, notification, audit,
review, and scheduler architecture.

**Added:**

- `20260714180000_attendance_crm_closing_policy.sql` with structured branch close
  settings, effective rule/category history, per-record snapshots, a durable
  intervention outbox, transactional provisional auto-close, and real-QR
  same-row reconciliation.
- Owner selected-branch Attendance Rules UI/actions, shared category/policy
  resolvers, the secure intervention route/worker, and focused policy, migration,
  and component tests.

**Changed:**

- CRM Closing clock-out metrics now use the exact inclusive branch-close-to-buffer
  window instead of the raw 1:30 AM schedule end.
- Scan processing detects a provisional system close and reconciles a later real
  QR scan without creating a second check-in; notification/task delivery uses
  stable intervention keys.
- Existing Recovery rule writes append to the same effective rule history, and
  records/staff-portal types expose policy and confirmation evidence.

**Verification:** `pnpm type-check` passes; ESLint exits 0 with one pre-existing
unused-function warning; focused policy/migration/UI validation passes at 4 files /
62 tests; the complete suite passes at 127 files / 921 tests; Next.js 16.2.4
production build passes with 110 static pages; and `git diff --check` passes.
Linked read-only probes confirm the prior Attendance tables but correctly report
the three new migration tables absent. Remote migration apply was deliberately not
attempted while migration history remains unreconciled.

## 2026-07-15 - Codex (ATTENDANCE-SCAN-RESULTS-AND-RECORD-FIRST-001)

**Task:** Preserve the secure one-scan phone-registration continuation and add
the missing record-first outside-hours result, personalized committed copy, and
secondary review signal without redesigning Attendance.

**Changed:**

- Ordinary first scans outside both ordinary windows now resolve to a written
  clock-in with an `ambiguous_scan` review exception; genuine first-closing
  ambiguity remains capture-only and security failures remain blocked.
- Added deterministic nickname/first-name/fallback Attendance greetings using
  branch-local time and stable request/business-date inputs. The committed backend
  title/message now drive the existing green success card.
- Added backward-compatible `reviewLabel` and branch-timezone result fields,
  compact accessible amber review badges, calm captured-closing copy, and removal
  of public operation/security implementation details.
- Clarified the first-phone login copy while preserving its signed continuation,
  secure cookie, ownership/branch/revocation checks, same-scan completion, and
  `nextScanRequired: false` contract.

**Verification:** `pnpm type-check` passes; focused ESLint passes; focused
Attendance checks pass at 7 files / 70 tests; the full suite passes at 130 files /
956 tests; and the Next.js 16.2.4 production build passes with 110 static pages.
Full lint exits 0 with one unrelated existing unused-function warning. Browser QA
verified the invalid-QR blocked state and authenticated CRM QR detail with no
console errors; a real staff credential/valid-phone mutation was not submitted.

### 2026-07-16 — PowerShell automation

**Task:** BRANCH-ASSIGNMENT-PATTERN-001 — Cut Branch Corrections over to the authoritative branch-assignment resolver.
**Files Changed:** CRM Staff page/actions/workspace, branch assignment UI, Attendance scan engine, and Supabase migrations.
**Notes:** Branch resolution no longer replays the original Attendance scan. Successful decisions return rescan_required and staff scan again normally.
**Build Status:** Pending automated checks in this script.

# 2026-07-21 — RELEASE-READINESS-001-RESUME

Verified the partial Attendance status, stale-recovery, device-branch, enforcement, AI Coach, and navigation work with 60 focused tests. Added read-only Attendance cron verification, operator runbook, migration-history audit/inspection/runbook, operational checklist, and read-only database preflight.

Made couples, besties, Spa Party, and other multi-person services consultation/manual only by reusing service consultation metadata with conservative catalogue fallback. Public booking context identifies the mode, manipulated booking actions are rejected before assignment, the catalogue contact CTA remains, and CRM manual booking stays available.

Hardened public booking and waitlist input with honeypots, strict schemas, byte limits, durable cooldown duplicate checks, safe errors, and structured logs. Added release-hardening contracts. Hid the unfinished Owner image-upload placeholder and performed conservative cleanup without deleting dormant Manager, Availability, AI Coach, grouped-booking, migration, recovery, or operational assets.

Validation: TypeScript and production build pass; 150 files / 1,137 tests pass; lint has zero errors and one pre-existing dormant Attendance warning; diff check passes. Linked database lint remains blocked by pooler timeout, and production/browser/device/cron/pilot evidence remains operator work.
