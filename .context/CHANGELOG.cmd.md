### 2026-05-11 — Kimi (MGR-MOB-001 — Mobile Manager Workspace)

**Task:** Create a mobile-first simplified Manager Workspace that activates only on mobile breakpoints without breaking the existing desktop experience.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/manager/mobile/types.ts` — shared mobile types
- `src/components/features/manager/mobile/manager-mobile-workspace.tsx` — main mobile orchestrator with tab state
- `src/components/features/manager/mobile/manager-bottom-nav.tsx` — fixed bottom navigation (Today, Schedule, Bookings, Staff, More)
- `src/components/features/manager/mobile/manager-today-screen.tsx` — greeting, KPIs, quick actions, today's flow, attention needed
- `src/components/features/manager/mobile/manager-schedule-screen.tsx` — staff schedule list with filter pills
- `src/components/features/manager/mobile/manager-bookings-screen.tsx` — bookings/issues cards with search and filters
- `src/components/features/manager/mobile/manager-staff-screen.tsx` — active/pending/off-duty staff cards

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/page.tsx` — responsive wrapper (hidden md:block desktop / block md:hidden mobile); fetches schedule + staff data for mobile while preserving desktop props exactly

**Design Decisions:**
- Desktop workspace is completely untouched; same component tree, same props, same data flow.
- Mobile workspace reuses existing data queries and utility functions (computeKpiData, computeAlerts, getUrgencyScore, readRelation, etc.).
- Bottom nav uses Lucide icons with large tap targets and clear active states.
- All screens use card-based layouts, large text, and spa design tokens (--cs-*).
- Empty states are included on every list screen.
- Placeholder actions (Review/Resolve) are rendered with disabled state where full server action wiring does not yet exist.

**Build Status:** ✅ Passing | **Type-check:** ✅ Passing | **Lint:** ✅ Passing (0 errors, 0 warnings)

### 2026-05-12 — Kimi (ONBOARD-001 — Eliminate Legacy Invite Flow, Refine Public Onboarding)

**Task:** Remove the insecure legacy invite flow (`/onboard/[staffId]`) that created incomplete staff records. Refine the public `/staff-onboarding` page to be the single entry point for staff applications, with proper `staff_type` mapping from the applicant's selected role.

**Files Removed:**
- `src/app/onboard/[staffId]/page.tsx` — legacy invite claim page
- `src/app/onboard/[staffId]/onboard-form.tsx` — legacy invite claim form
- `src/lib/queries/staff.ts` — removed unused `getStaffForOnboard` query

**Files Created:**
- `src/app/onboard/page.tsx` — simple redirect to `/staff-onboarding`

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/staff/actions.ts`
  - Removed `generateInviteAction` — no longer creates incomplete "Pending Invitation" staff rows.
  - Removed `onboardStaffAction` — eliminated the unauthenticated auth-user creation security hole.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/staff/invite/page.tsx`
  - Rewritten as a read-only info page. Passes `onboardingUrl` and `accessCode` to the form.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/staff/invite/invite-form.tsx`
  - Rewritten to display the public onboarding URL and access code with copy buttons.
  - Removed `generateInviteAction` dependency.
  - Added link to Onboarding Requests page.
- `src/app/staff-onboarding/actions.ts`
  - Added `mapPreferredRoleToStaffType()` helper: `therapist`→`therapist`, `csr`→`csr`, `driver`→`driver`, `utility`→`utility`, `other`→`therapist`.
  - `submitStaffOnboardingAction`: now sets `staff_type` on the created inactive staff row.
  - `submitStaffOnboardingAction`: fixed `requested_branch_id` to use the resolved `branchId` (fallback to first branch) instead of potentially-null `preferredBranchId`.
  - `approveOnboardingAction`: now derives and sets `staff_type` from the request's `preferred_role` when activating the staff record.
- `docs/MVP_SYSTEM_SCORE_REPORT.md`
  - Marked C5 (`onboardStaffAction` security) and H4 (`generateInviteAction` validation) as ✅ FIXED.
  - Updated RBAC score from 6→7 and risks table.

**Behavior:**
- All staff onboarding now goes through `/staff-onboarding` (protected by `STAFF_ONBOARDING_ACCESS_CODE`).
- Applicants select their intended role during onboarding; the inactive staff record captures the matching `staff_type`.
- Owner/manager reviews applications in `/owner/staff/onboarding` or `/manager/staff/onboarding`.
- On approval, the staff record is activated with the reviewer-assigned `system_role`, `tier`, `branch_id`, and the applicant's `staff_type`.
- No more incomplete "Pending Invitation" staff rows polluting the database.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 76 app routes.

### 2026-05-12 — Kimi (ONBOARD-002 — CRM Staff Applications Review)

**Task:** Enable authorized CSR (front-desk) users to review and approve normal operational staff applications directly from the CRM workspace. This avoids the need for full Manager workspace access during MVP.

**Files Created:**
- `docs/MVP_TEMPORARY_PERMISSIONS.md` — documented temporary MVP permission rules
- `src/components/features/staff-onboarding/onboarding-review-list.tsx` — reusable review component extracted from owner dashboard
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/staff-applications/page.tsx` — new CRM staff application review page

**Files Removed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/staff/onboarding/review-list.tsx` — replaced by the reusable component

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/staff/approval-permissions.ts`
  - Updated CSR/CRM assignable roles to include `csr_staff`, `driver`, `utility`, and `staff`.
  - Enforced sensitive role restriction (CSR cannot approve managers/admins).
- `src/components/features/dashboard/nav-config.ts`
  - Added "Staff Applications" to CRM, CSR Head, and CSR Staff navigation.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/staff/onboarding/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/staff/onboarding/page.tsx`
  - Refactored to use the new reusable `OnboardingReviewList` component.

**Behavior:**
- CSR users see "Staff Applications" in their sidebar.
- CSRs can review applicants for their assigned branch.
- CSRs can approve only operational roles; management roles show "Owner/Manager required" and have the Approve button disabled.
- Fixed role mapping: CSR applicants now default to `system_role: csr_staff` when reviewed, ensuring they land in the correct workspace.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 77 app routes.

### 2026-05-13 — Kimi (BRANCH-SOT-001 — Public Branch Address Source of Truth)

**Task:** Unify public branch/contact data into a single database source of truth. Eliminate dual-sourcing between `branches` table and hardcoded `public-site-data.ts`.

**Files Created:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260516000001_branch_public_fields.sql` — adds `opening_hours`, `secondary_phone`, `sort_order` to `branches`

**Files Changed:**
- `src/types/supabase.ts` — added `opening_hours`, `secondary_phone`, `sort_order` to `branches` Row/Insert/Update types
- `src/lib/queries/branches.ts` — added `getPublicBranches()` helper (active branches ordered by `sort_order`, then `name`)
- `src/lib/public/public-site-data.ts` — marked `publicPhones` and `publicBranches` as `@deprecated` with explanation
- `src/app/(public)/layout.tsx` — now async; fetches `getPublicBranches()` and passes `primaryPhone` to `SiteHeader`, `branches` to `SiteFooter`
- `src/app/page.tsx` — now async; fetches `getPublicBranches()`, passes to `SiteHeader`, `SiteFooter`, `PublicMobileHome`, `HomePageSections`; FAQ answers now dynamically list branch names from DB
- `src/app/(public)/contact/page.tsx` — uses branch data for primary/secondary phones, opening hours, branch name/address cards, and CTA call button
- `src/app/(public)/branches/page.tsx` — switched to `getPublicBranches()`; per-branch `opening_hours` replaces hardcoded "Daily · 9:00 AM – 9:00 PM"
- `src/components/public/site-header.tsx` — accepts `primaryPhone` prop instead of importing hardcoded `publicPhones`
- `src/components/public/site-footer.tsx` — accepts `branches` prop; derives hours text from first branch `opening_hours`
- `src/components/public/home-page-sections.tsx` — accepts `branches` prop; contact section phones, branch cards, and CTA buttons now use branch data
- `src/components/public/mobile/public-mobile-home.tsx` — accepts `branches` prop; FAQ branch answer is now dynamic
- `src/components/public/mobile/public-mobile-contact.tsx` — `primaryPhoneHref()` now uses first branch phone; opening hours uses branch `opening_hours`
- `src/components/public/mobile/public-mobile-branches.tsx` — uses `branch.opening_hours` instead of hardcoded fallback text

**Design Decisions:**
- Marketing narrative (hero copy, proof points, trust points) remains in `public-site-data.ts` and `public_site_sections` table. Only operational contact/address/hours data was migrated.
- All components keep safe fallbacks when branch data is missing: "Contact info updating", "Branch details are being updated", etc.
- `getPublicBranches()` orders by `sort_order` then `name`, giving owners control over display order without code changes.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 4 pre-existing warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 77 app routes.

### 2026-05-13 — Kimi (PAYMENT-001 — Manual Payment Recording Capability)

**Task:** Wire PaymentActionMenu into all workspace contexts, create booking_payment_logs audit table, and ensure all payment changes are logged with old→new values.

**Files Created:**

- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/bookings/actions.ts` — `ownerUpdateBookingPaymentAction` now reads old values, inserts audit log, then updates
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/bookings/actions.ts` — `updateBookingPaymentAction` now reads old values, inserts audit log, then updates
- `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-details-panel.tsx` — fixed hardcoded payment values, now passes actual booking payment state
- `src/lib/queries/schedule.ts` — `DailyScheduleBooking` type extended with payment fields
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/bookings/page.tsx` — wired `updateBookingPaymentAction`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/schedule/page.tsx` — wired `updateBookingPaymentAction`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/bookings/page.tsx` — wired `updateBookingPaymentAction`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/schedule/page.tsx` — wired `updateBookingPaymentAction`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/today/page.tsx` — computes `price_paid` from metadata, passes `paymentAction` to queue panel
- `src/components/features/crm/today/crm-booking-queue-panel.tsx` — added inline `PaymentActionMenu` on each card with event propagation stop

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing

### 2026-05-13 — Kimi (CONTROL-001 — Booking Control Console MVP)

**Task:** Create a professional operational control page for manager and CRM users showing today's bookings with KPIs, progress status, payment actions, and home-service warnings.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/control-console/types.ts` — `ControlBooking` and `ControlTab` types
- `src/components/features/control-console/control-kpi-strip.tsx` — 7 KPI cards (Total, Active, In Progress, Completed, Unpaid, Home Service, Issues)
- `src/components/features/control-console/control-booking-card.tsx` — Enhanced booking card with progress mini-stepper, payment badge, status badge, home-service warnings, and inline action buttons
- `src/components/features/control-console/control-queue.tsx` — Filterable queue with tabs: All, Active, Home, In Spa, Unpaid, Issues

- `src/components/features/dashboard/nav-config.ts` — added "Control" to Manager, CRM, CSR Head, and CSR Staff navigation

**Design Decisions:**
- Reuses `getTodaysSchedule` and existing server actions (`updateBookingPaymentAction`, `updateBookingStatusAction`).
- No new external APIs, no live maps, no GPS tracking.
- Cards show progress as a compact dot stepper rather than full timeline.
- Home service warnings (dispatch_warning, needs_location_review) are shown as red banners at the top of affected cards.
- Issues tab surfaces: dispatch warnings, location review needs, missing room assignments, and unassigned staff.
- Staff availability diagnostic is a placeholder linking to Schedule/Staff settings pages.
- Owner control console is documented as a Phase 3.1 follow-up (requires cross-branch today's schedule query).

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 4 pre-existing warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 79 app routes.

**Follow-up:**
- Phase 3.1: Owner cross-branch control console.
- Phase 4: Booking Delivery Type Cleanup (`in_spa` as first-class type).

### 2026-05-13 — Kimi (MGR-STAFF-001 — Manager Staff Parity)

**Task:** Give Manager workspace the same staff-management capabilities as Owner, safely branch-scoped, without redesigning staff management.

**Files Created:**
- `docs/MANAGER_STAFF_PARITY_AUDIT.md` — full audit of Owner vs Manager staff capabilities, gaps, safe parity plan, and implementation summary
- `src/components/features/staff/staff-edit-form.tsx` — shared reusable staff edit form extracted from Owner route
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/staff/[staffId]/page.tsx` — Manager staff detail/edit page (branch-scoped)

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/staff/[staffId]/page.tsx` — refactored to use shared `StaffEditForm`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/staff/[staffId]/staff-edit-form.tsx` — DELETED (replaced by shared component)
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/staff/actions.ts` — hardened `updateStaffAction` with sensitive-role guards, manager-safe role enforcement, branch-change validation, and revalidation of both owner and manager paths
- `src/components/features/staff/staff-preview-panel.tsx` — Manager now sees "Change Role" and "Deactivate Staff" quick actions; "Assign Branch" remains Owner-only
- `src/components/features/manager/mobile/manager-staff-screen.tsx` — Staff cards are now clickable `Link` elements to detail pages
- `src/components/features/control-console/control-console-page.tsx` — fixed pre-existing `<a>` → `<Link>` lint error

**Behavior:**
- Manager can now edit staff profiles, update roles (manager-safe only), change tier/level, assign service capabilities, activate/deactivate, and toggle department head — all for staff in their branch.
- Branch field is locked to manager's branch.
- Protected accounts (owner, manager, assistant_manager, store_manager, super_admin, platform_admin) show "This action requires owner approval." and cannot be modified by manager.
- Owner staff management is untouched and continues to work with full controls.
- Mobile manager staff tab now links to detail edit pages.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 4 pre-existing warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 80 app routes.

**Follow-up:**
- Manager direct-invite (`/manager/staff/new`) if business wants managers to create staff directly.
- Staff delete/soft-delete if needed (currently only deactivate).

### 2026-05-13 - Codex (STAFF-ORG-001 - Staff Edit Organization & Access Model)

**Task:** Fix Staff Edit so it mirrors the full organizational model from owner-level access through operational staff, while keeping workspace access, job function, and supervisor status distinct.

**Files Created:**
- `src/constants/staff-roles.ts` - shared typed source for supported `system_role`, `staff_type`, service staff types, labels, options, sensitive role policy, and assignable role policy.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/constants/staff.ts` - compatibility re-export from the shared catalog.
- `src/lib/validations/staff.ts` - staff create/update schemas now accept every DB-supported system role and existing staff type.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/staff/actions.ts` - manager-safe role assignment and protected-role checks now use shared policy; non-service staff clear service mappings server-side.
- `src/components/features/staff/staff-edit-form.tsx` - added Organization & Access section, full role/function options, leadership toggle help text, active status help text, and service fields only for service staff functions.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/staff/new/staff-invite-form.tsx` - direct invite now uses the same role/function source and conditional service capability logic.
- `src/components/features/staff/staff-branch-section.tsx`, `staff-table-row.tsx`, `staff-preview-panel.tsx`, `staff-management-utils.ts`, `staff-filter-bar.tsx`, `staff-management-workspace.tsx` - display now separates Workspace Access from Staff Function and shows Head / Supervisor as distinct metadata.
- `src/lib/staff/approval-permissions.ts` - onboarding approval role lists now reuse shared assignable role arrays.
- `src/app/(auth)/login/actions.ts` - login redirect now uses shared role routing for driver, utility, service, and manager variant roles.
- `src/types/index.ts` - re-exports shared system roles and broadens staff tier typing to current schema values.
- `eslint.config.mjs` - ignores generated `.claude/**` worktree output so lint does not scan build artifacts.

**Behavior:**
- Driver, utility, CSR/front-desk, managerial, salon head, therapist, nail tech, and aesthetician functions are available in edit/direct invite.
- Owner can assign all DB-supported access roles; manager can assign only operational roles.
- Managers cannot edit protected owner/manager-level records or assign forbidden high-level access.
- Service assignment appears only for therapist, nail tech, aesthetician, and salon head.
- Saving driver/utility/CSR/managerial functions clears `staff_services` mappings even if stale client data is submitted.
- Defensive admin-like role names remain protected but are not exposed because current DB constraints do not support them.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 2 pre-existing warnings in staff onboarding form)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 79 app routes.

**Hotfix:**
- Added `public/sw.js` as a self-unregistering service worker cleanup script and no-store `/sw.js` headers in `next.config.ts`.
- Reason: browser logs showed stale `/sw.js` activity and stale client chunks still requiring the old `@base-ui/react/button` module after the Button component moved to Radix Slot.
- Verification after hotfix: `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm lint`, and `pnpm build` still pass.

### 2026-05-14 - Codex (PHASE-10.1 - Compact Precise Home-Service Location Input)

**Task:** Refine the existing public booking wizard home-service location step into a compact Google-Maps-style precise location input.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/public/places-autocomplete.tsx` - extended the shared Places wrapper to return formatted address, place ID, lat/lng, address components, map URL, and load/error status without exposing the server Maps key.
- `src/components/public/booking-wizard.tsx` - public home-service location step now shows one Google Places search field, a compact selected-location confirmation card with Change, and one merged Delivery notes textarea.
- `src/lib/validations/booking.ts` - public multi-service booking validation now requires a selected Google place for home-service bookings while leaving in-spa unaffected.
- `src/lib/actions/online-booking.ts` - server action now enforces precise home-service place data and saves `formatted_address`, `place_id`, `lat`, `lng`, `address_components`, `map_url`, `source: "google_places"`, and `delivery_notes` while preserving legacy address/notes/zone keys.

**Behavior:**
- Public home-service customers must select a Google suggestion before continuing; typed text alone is rejected.
- Customer-facing zone, house/unit, landmark, and separate driver-note fields were removed/merged into a single Delivery notes field.
- Metadata keeps `zone: "unknown"` when customers are not asked to choose a zone, while precise lat/lng remain available for dispatch/ETA systems.
- In-spa booking flow is unchanged.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 2 pre-existing warnings in staff onboarding form)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 79 app routes.

- `src/components/features/notifications/notification-bell-dropdown.tsx` - bell dropdown alias around the grouped popover.

**Files Changed:**

- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/page.tsx` - manager dashboard surfaces open workflow tasks in a calm attention strip.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/staff/onboarding/page.tsx` - manager onboarding page passes open workflow tasks to the review list.

- `src/lib/notifications/queries.ts` - active notification reads include resolved items for grouped inbox compatibility.
- `src/lib/notifications/types.ts`, `src/types/supabase.ts` - added workflow task and dedupe types.

**Behavior:**
- `staff_onboarding.submitted` creates one manager workflow task and one applicant status update.
- Routine onboarding no longer creates an urgent owner notification.
- CRM receives no staff onboarding notification.
- Missing service selections are metadata on the same manager review task, not a second manager notification.
- Approval/rejection resolves the manager workflow task and old legacy onboarding notifications for that request.
- Applicant receives one deduped approval/rejection status update.
- Existing direct notification callers remain compatible but now use dedupe keys.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: Passing.
- `pnpm lint`: Passing with 2 pre-existing warnings in `src/app/staff-onboarding/onboarding-form.tsx`.
- `pnpm build`: Passing, 80 app routes.

### 2026-05-14 — Claude (MOBILE-001 — Mobile-First Staff & Driver Portal)

**Task:** Add mobile-first UI to Staff Portal and Driver Portal without breaking existing desktop layouts.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/mobile/staff-mobile-bottom-nav.tsx` — Fixed mobile bottom nav (5 items) with active state
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/mobile/staff-mobile-home.tsx` — Full service staff mobile home: greeting, next action card, today timeline, overview stats, home service alert, quick links

- `src/app/(dashboard)/driver/page.tsx` — Added `hidden md:block` / `block md:hidden` split; desktop unchanged, mobile renders DriverMobileHome

**Also in this session (schedule task):**
- `src/lib/staff-portal/schedule.ts` — StaffScheduleEvent type + buildDayEvents/buildWeekEvents helpers
- `src/app/(dashboard)/staff-portal/schedule/page.tsx` — My Schedule server route
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/staff-schedule-page.tsx` — Schedule client component (week grid + mobile agenda + bottom nav)
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/staff-schedule-page.module.css` — Schedule CSS module

### 2026-05-14 - Codex (BOOKING-WIZARD-UX-10.2 - Public Booking Wizard Optimization)

**Task:** Fix active public booking wizard Places usage, compact the service-selection UX, and restrict specific staff selection to real qualified service providers.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/public/booking-service-picker.tsx` - extracted compact category-based booking service picker used by the wizard.
- `src/lib/staff/service-providers.ts` - shared guard for service-provider eligibility, hard-excluding driver/utility system roles and non-service job functions.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/public/booking-wizard.tsx` - delegates service selection to the compact picker; staff picker now keeps Any Available as default and hides unqualified providers.
- `src/components/public/places-autocomplete.tsx` - selected place result now carries `source: "google_places"` while continuing to use `google.maps.importLibrary("places")` and `PlaceAutocompleteElement`.
- `src/app/api/public/booking-context/route.ts` - public booking context now preserves service category metadata and returns staff service mappings for eligibility-aware filtering.
- `src/lib/engine/availability.ts` - availability results and auto-assignment now filter out driver, utility, CSR/front-desk, admin/owner/manager-only staff; selected staff must satisfy service capability constraints when mappings exist.
- `src/lib/actions/online-booking.ts` - multi-service specific staff submission now verifies eligibility against all selected services, not only the first.
- `src/features/maps/GoogleMapsProvider.tsx`, `src/features/maps/PlaceAutocompleteInput.tsx`, `src/features/maps/README.md` - browser map key usage now standardizes on `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_BROWSER_KEY`; the provider no longer requests legacy Places libraries.

**Behavior:**
- Active `/book` path has no legacy `google.maps.places.Autocomplete`, `AutocompleteService`, `PlacesService`, `libraries=places`, or `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` usage under `src`.
- Public home-service location remains a single Places API (New) search field, selected-location confirmation card, and optional delivery notes field.
- Service selection shows one category at a time instead of expanding the full catalog.
- Multi-service selection, total duration, and total price remain intact.

### 2026-05-15 — Claude Code (Phase 0 Stabilization — Batch 2)

**Task:** SECURITY-STAB-002 — Phase 0 security stabilization batch 2 (9 blockers)

**Files Changed:**
- `src/proxy.ts` — Removed unconditional userId+role log on every request; replaced with dev-only `console.debug`; also removed userId from the "no active staff record" path log.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/staff/actions.ts` — Replaced full raw-input `console.log` and full Zod-issues `console.error` in `updateStaffAction` with dev-only `console.debug` using safe boolean metadata only. No PII or payload logged in production.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/marketing/actions.ts` — Added `createClient`/`isDevAuthBypassEnabled` imports, `requireOwner()` helper, and owner auth guard to all four exported actions (saveMarketingSectionAction, createMarketingAssetAction, updateMarketingAssetAction, disableMarketingAssetAction). [Batch 1 — completed prior step]
- `src/lib/dev-bypass.ts` — Production guard already present (NODE_ENV !== "production"); no change required.
- `src/lib/logger.ts` — Created structured logger with `logError` and `logWarn`; stacks only in development; always emits JSON to stderr.
- `src/lib/actions/driver-actions.ts` — Replaced 2 silent `catch {}` blocks with `logError` calls (getBranchBookingDriverIds, getAvailableBranchDrivers).
- `src/lib/actions/eta-actions.ts` — Replaced 1 silent `catch {}` with `logError` (getNextBookingForStaff).
- `src/lib/actions/live-ops-actions.ts` — Replaced 1 silent `catch {}` with `logError` (getActiveTripsForOpsMap).
- `src/lib/actions/location-actions.ts` — Replaced 2 silent `catch {}` with `logError` (getLatestStaffLocationForBooking, getLatestLocationsForActiveHomeServiceTrips).
- `src/app/(dashboard)/dev/page.tsx` — Added `notFound()` guard in production; dev panel route now returns 404 in production.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/operations/page.tsx` — Added `redirect("/manager")` in production; Coming Soon tiles are hidden from real managers in production.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/bookings/actions.ts` — Added `.eq("branch_id", me.branch_id)` to the pre-confirmation booking fetch in `updateBookingStatusAction`; prevents cross-branch room-assignment probe.
- `next.config.ts` — Added baseline security headers (X-Frame-Options: DENY, X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy) for all routes.
- `.env.example` — Created with all 14 env vars found in `src/`; danger dev-bypass vars clearly marked.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: Passing.
- `pnpm lint`: Passing with only the 2 pre-existing warnings in `src/app/staff-onboarding/onboarding-form.tsx`.
- `pnpm build`: Passing, 80+ app routes compiled successfully.

### 2026-05-15 — Claude Code (Phase 1 Performance Quick Wins)

**Task:** PERF-PHASE1-001 — Phase 1 performance quick wins

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` — Removed redundant `force-dynamic` export; layout is already dynamic because `createClient()` calls `cookies()` from next/headers. Now uses `getLayoutStaffContext()` from the new cached helper instead of inline auth+staff DB calls.
- `src/lib/queries/staff-context.ts` — Created. React `cache()`-wrapped helper for the dashboard layout's auth + staff fetch. Deduplicates within a single request render tree. Sets up the pattern for Phase 2 broader deduplication.
- `src/lib/queries/branches.ts` — Added `getPublicBranchesCached` (React `cache()` wrapper around `getPublicBranches`). Deduplicates branch fetches within a request when multiple components in the public layout render tree call it.
- `src/app/(public)/layout.tsx` — Switched from `getPublicBranches` to `getPublicBranchesCached`.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/bookings/loading.tsx` — Created. Filter bar + booking row skeletons.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/schedule/loading.tsx` — Created. Date nav + timeline grid skeleton.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/settings/loading.tsx` — Created. Settings form section skeletons.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/loading.tsx` — Created. Stats strip + two-column content skeleton.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/bookings/loading.tsx` — Created. Search/filter bar + booking row skeletons.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/staff/loading.tsx` — Created. Search bar + staff card grid skeleton.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/staff-portal/loading.tsx` — Created. Greeting + stats + appointment card skeletons.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/staff-portal/schedule/loading.tsx` — Created. Week nav + day columns + appointment block skeletons.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/error.tsx` — Created. Manager workspace error boundary (client component with Try again reset).
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/error.tsx` — Created. CRM workspace error boundary.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/error.tsx` — Created. Owner workspace error boundary.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/staff-portal/error.tsx` — Created. Staff portal error boundary.

**What was intentionally NOT done in this phase:**
- No service worker / offline mode (Phase 3)
- No tag-based revalidation migration (Phase 2)
- No new DB indexes (Phase 2)
- No booking engine changes
- Dynamic import for Dispatch workspace: dispatch is currently mock data UI; not a priority.
- Cross-request cache for branches: React cache() deduplicates within a request; `unstable_cache` / ISR considered but deferred pending Next.js 16 behavioral verification.
- Target H (local refresh): no obvious safe wins found without deeper investigation.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: Passing.
- `pnpm lint`: Passing with only 2 pre-existing warnings in `src/app/staff-onboarding/onboarding-form.tsx`.
- `pnpm build`: Passing, 80+ app routes compiled successfully.

### 2026-05-15 — Claude Code (Phase 2 Database Request Optimization)

**Task:** PERF-PHASE2-001 — Phase 2 database request optimization

**Files Created:**
- `src/lib/queries/crm-context.ts` — Shared `getCrmContext()` helper for CRM page server components. Returns `{ role, branchId }` with owner getting `branchId: null` (cross-branch) and CRM/CSR roles getting their own `branch_id`.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/queries/customers.ts` — Added `branchCustomerIds()` private helper. Added optional `branchId?: string | null` parameter to `searchCustomers`, `getAllCustomers`, `getRepeatCustomers`, `getLapsedCustomers`, `getCrmStats`. When provided, each function first fetches distinct customer IDs from `bookings` for that branch, then filters customers via `.in("id", ids)`. Owners pass `null` and get unfiltered results. Also added a comment on `lookupCustomerByPhone` explaining it is intentionally not branch-scoped.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/actions.ts` — `requireCrmAccess()` now returns `{ supabase, branchId: string | null } | null` (was `supabase | null`). Now fetches `branch_id` from staff record. Owner role maps to `branchId: null`. Updated all callers to destructure `ctx` and pass `ctx.branchId` to query functions.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/customers/page.tsx` — Replaced local `getCsrContext()` + direct supabase calls with imported `getCrmContext()`. Passes `branchId` to `getAllCustomers(page, 25, branchId)`.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/repeats/page.tsx` — Added `getCrmContext()` import and call. Passes `branchId` to `getRepeatCustomers(2, page, 25, branchId)`. (Also adds a missing auth check — this page had no auth before.)
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/lapsed/page.tsx` — Added `getCrmContext()` import and call. Passes `branchId` to `getLapsedCustomers(30, 50, branchId)`. (Also adds a missing auth check — this page had no auth before.)
- `src/app/api/customers/search/route.ts` — Now fetches `branch_id` from the staff record in addition to `system_role`. Derives `branchId` (null for owners, `me.branch_id` for others) and passes to `searchCustomers(q, branchId)`.
- `src/lib/queries/staff.ts` — Added `.limit(500)` to both primary and fallback queries in `getAllStaff()`. Added `.limit(200)` to both queries in `getPendingStaff()`. Safety caps for the owner's cross-branch staff lists.
- `src/lib/queries/bookings.ts` — Added `.limit(50)` to `getBookingsByCustomer()` (customer profile booking history). Added `.limit(500)` safety cap to `getAllBookings()` (owner day view) and `getAllBookingsOwner()` (owner cross-branch booking list).

**What was intentionally NOT done in this phase:**
- `select("*")` wildcard replacement in branches and staff queries: The staff queries use a backward-compat fallback pattern that would be fragile to refactor. The branches table is small and `select("*")` is fine there. Deferred.
- Selective `revalidateTag` migration: Requires tagging all cached data and is a cross-cutting concern. The existing `revalidatePath` is correct. Deferred to Phase 3 if profiling shows stale-cache issues.
- DB index recommendations: No profiling data available. Adding indexes without evidence would be speculative. Deferred.
- `unstable_cache` / Next.js 16 `"use cache"` directive: Behavior in Next.js 16.2.4 was not verified. Deferred.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: Passing.
- `pnpm lint`: Passing with only 2 pre-existing warnings in `src/app/staff-onboarding/onboarding-form.tsx`.
- `pnpm build`: Passing, 80+ app routes compiled successfully.

### 2026-05-15 — Claude (PERF-PHASE2B-001 — Query Pagination + Index Planning)

**Task:** Phase 2B — Shared pagination utility, CRM customer paginated search, index audit.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/queries/pagination.ts` (NEW) — Shared pagination helpers: `PaginationParams`, `PaginatedResult<T>`, `normalizePagination()`, `toPaginatedResult()`. Normalizes page/pageSize with safe bounds; wraps Supabase count responses.
- `src/lib/queries/customers.ts` — Added `CustomerPageRow` exported type and `getCustomersPage()` function combining branch scoping + ILIKE search (with `%_` escaping) + server-side pagination via `.range(from, to)` with `count: "exact"`.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/customers/page.tsx` — Switched from `getAllCustomers` to `getCustomersPage`. Added `q` search param support. Added plain `<form method="GET">` search bar (no client state). Quick action cards hidden during active search. Pagination Prev/Next links now preserve `q` param via `encodeURIComponent`. EmptyState shows search-specific messaging.
- `docs/audits/QUERY_INDEX_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` (NEW) — Full audit of existing indexes from `20260429000002_indexes.sql`, identified `bookings(branch_id, customer_id)` as the key missing index for `branchCustomerIds()`, documented all bounded/unbounded queries.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/dev/page.tsx` — Fixed pre-existing TS2367 errors (NODE_ENV type narrowing after `notFound()` guard). Extracted `nodeEnv` variable before the guard.
- `src/lib/logger.ts` — Fixed pre-existing TS2345 errors by widening `LogContext` from `Record<string, string | number | boolean | null | undefined>` to `Record<string, unknown>` so `error: unknown` in catch blocks passes without casts.

**Scope deliberately NOT changed:**
- Booking list pages (manager/CRM/owner): already date+branch scoped, naturally bounded — no pagination needed.
- Staff list pages: `StaffManagementWorkspace` uses client-side filtering on safety-capped (500/200) server results. Pagination would require UI redesign. Deferred.
- `public-site.ts` list queries: CMS tables with owner-defined content — small by design, no limit needed.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 2 pre-existing warnings in `staff-onboarding/onboarding-form.tsx`)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 79+ app routes compiled successfully

### 2026-05-15 — Claude (PERF-PHASE3-001 — Selective Revalidation and Cache Tags)

**Task:** Phase 3 — Replace selected broad `revalidatePath()` usage with scoped cache tags using `unstable_cache` on stable read data.

**Files Created:**
- `src/lib/cache/cache-tags.ts` — Tag constants (`publicBranches`, `branchBookingRules(id)`, `branchServices(id)`) and `invalidateTag()` wrapper that handles Next.js 16's required second `profile` argument to `revalidateTag`.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/queries/branches.ts` — Upgraded `getPublicBranchesCached` from `React.cache()` (per-request only) to `React.cache(unstable_cache(...))` (cross-request + per-request dedup). Added `getBranchServicesPublicCached(branchId)` using `createAdminClient()` + `unstable_cache`; tags `branch-services:{branchId}`, TTL 300s.
- `src/lib/queries/branch-booking-rules.ts` — Added `getBranchBookingRulesOrDefaultCached(branchId)` using `unstable_cache`; tags `branch-booking-rules:{branchId}`, TTL 3600s. `updateBranchBookingRules` now calls `invalidateTag` on commit.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/branches/actions.ts` — All branch mutations (`createBranchAction`, `updateBranchAction`, `toggleBranchActiveAction`) now call `invalidateTag(cacheTags.publicBranches)`. All service mutations (`removeBranchServiceAction`, `addBranchServiceAction`, `updateBranchServiceEligibilityAction`, `updateBranchServicePriceAction`, `updateBranchServiceVisibilityAction`) now call `invalidateTag(cacheTags.branchServices(branchId))`.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/services/actions.ts` — `setBranchServiceAction` now calls `invalidateTag(cacheTags.branchServices(d.branchId))`.
- `src/app/api/public/booking-context/route.ts` — Hot path now uses `getBranchServicesPublicCached` (when `publicOnly=true`) and `getBranchBookingRulesOrDefaultCached`. Inhouse context (publicOnly=false) keeps uncached `getBranchServices`.
- `src/app/api/public/dispatch-slots/route.ts` — Now uses `getBranchBookingRulesOrDefaultCached`.

**Domains cached:**
1. Public branches (`public-branches` tag, 1h TTL)
2. Branch booking rules per branch (`branch-booking-rules:{id}` tag, 1h TTL)
3. Branch services — public-only (`branch-services:{id}` tag, 5min TTL)

**Intentionally NOT cached:**
- `getBranchesOverview` — includes live stats (today's bookings, active staff count)
- `getBranchWithFullDetail` — owner edit page; includes live staff list
- All booking/dispatch/schedule data
- Inhouse context service list (user-facing, may differ by role)
- Notification, payroll, reconciliation data

**Revalidation paths kept:**
- All existing `revalidatePath()` calls preserved alongside the new `invalidateTag()` calls. The path invalidation clears Next.js route cache; the tag invalidation clears the `unstable_cache` function result. Both are needed.

**Next.js 16 compatibility note:**
- `revalidateTag` in Next.js 16 requires a second `profile` argument. The `invalidateTag(tag)` wrapper in `cache-tags.ts` passes `{}` (empty `CacheLifeConfig`) as the profile, which works for `unstable_cache` entries.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 2 pre-existing warnings in `staff-onboarding/onboarding-form.tsx`)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 79+ app routes compiled

### 2026-05-15 — Claude (PERF-PHASE4-001 — Offline / Poor Connectivity Resilience)

**Task:** Phase 4 — Protect all write-path flows from silent failures when the device has no connectivity.

**Files Created:**
- `src/hooks/use-network-status.ts` — `useNetworkStatus()` hook using `useSyncExternalStore` (React 18) to subscribe to `navigator.onLine` / `online` / `offline` events. Returns `{ isOnline, isOffline, wasOffline, lastChangedAt }`. Server snapshot returns `true` (assume online). No hydration mismatch.
- `src/components/shared/offline-banner.tsx` — `"use client"` fixed-position banner (`z-index: 9999`). Two states: offline (dark charcoal, `WifiOff` icon, `aria-live="assertive"`) and back-online (dark green, `aria-live="polite"`). Renders nothing when connectivity never changed.
- `docs/audits/OFFLINE_RESILIENCE_PLAN.md` — Full implementation plan documenting each target, what was protected, what was intentionally excluded, and next steps.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` — Imports and renders `<OfflineBanner />` inside the outer flex container (renders before Sidebar + Header).
- `src/app/(public)/layout.tsx` — Imports and renders `<OfflineBanner />` before `<SiteHeader>`.
- `src/components/public/booking-wizard.tsx` — Added `useNetworkStatus()`. `handleSubmit` early-returns with "You're offline. Check your connection and try again." when `isOffline`. "Confirm Booking" button `disabled={!canProceed || submitting || isOffline}`. Network-error server responses show retry-friendly message.
- `src/components/features/dashboard/booking-action-menu.tsx` — Added `useNetworkStatus()`. `handleAction` short-circuits when `isOffline`, sets inline feedback with retry message. Trigger button disabled when offline. Action failure copy includes "Check your connection and try again."
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/booking-progress-actions.tsx` — Added `useNetworkStatus()`. `handleAdvance` early-returns when `isPending || isOffline`. Both action buttons (advance + no-show) disabled when offline. Cursor/opacity styles updated.

**Components NOT changed (low priority, covered by banner):**
- `staff-weekly-hours-editor.tsx`, `branch-services-panel.tsx`, `reconciliation-form.tsx`, `waitlist-queue.tsx`, `onboarding-form.tsx`

**`public/sw.js`:** Confirmed self-unregistering — no changes made.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 2 pre-existing warnings in `staff-onboarding/onboarding-form.tsx`)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 79 routes

### 2026-05-18 — Claude (UI-STAFF-EDIT-001)

**Task:** Manager Staff Approval Page — compact redesign with Sheet-based service picker

**Problem solved:** The previous staff edit page rendered all service chips at once (CradleHub has 50–100+ services across categories). This caused visual overload and made the page feel like a raw admin form.

**Solution:** Two-phase UX — main page shows a summary, detailed editing opens in a Sheet.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/staff/staff-service-editor-sheet.tsx` — Sheet-based service capability editor. Collapsible category rows (accordion, one open at a time). Each category shows "N selected / M total". Expanded rows: selected chips first, then unselected, max 8 per category with "Show more". Search mode: bypass accordion, show all matching grouped. Filter chips: "All services" / "Selected (N)". Quick actions per category: Select all, Clear. `aria-pressed` on service chips for accessibility.
- (rewrite) `src/components/features/staff/staff-approval-workspace.tsx` — Orchestrator + focused sub-components in one file: `PageHeader` (back link, avatar, name, status badge, dirty indicator), `DraftRestoreBanner` (localStorage restore offer), `StaffInformationCard` (3-col compact grid: name spans full width, others pair up), `ServiceSummaryCard` (count + up to 6 preview chips + "+X more" + "Edit services" button), `ApprovalSummaryPanel` (sticky right: branch/role/job/tier/status/services rows with change markers, service message green/orange, internal tier note, Approve & Activate / Save / Discard actions). Draft includes `isActive`. Lazy `useState` initializers read localStorage without `setState-in-effect`.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/staff/[staffId]/page.tsx` — maxWidth 760→1100, removed PageHeader+StaffEditForm, uses StaffApprovalWorkspace

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 80 routes

### 2026-05-20 - Codex (BOOKING-HOME-SERVICES-001 - Public Home Service Availability)

**Task:** Fixed public booking home-service availability mismatch.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/queries/branches.ts` - corrected the public booking branch-service query to read the same Home/Public branch-service source of truth used by admin service management, while preserving legacy fallbacks.
- `src/app/api/public/booking-context/route.ts` - preserved branch-specific custom duration in public booking service payloads.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/branches/actions.ts` - updated service visibility writes to use current `visibility` first, with a legacy `booking_visibility` fallback.
- `src/lib/cache/cache-tags.ts` - changed branch-service cache invalidation to expire immediately after service setting changes.
- `src/types/supabase.ts` - synced local `branch_services` metadata fields with the live schema used by booking/admin queries.
- `eslint.config.mjs`, `.gitignore` - ignored Codex artifact output so temporary verification files do not get linted or shown as untracked source.
- `.context/CURRENT_TASK.cmd.md`, `.context/HANDOFF.cmd.md`, `.context/ERRORS.cmd.md`, `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md` - updated project context and handoff notes.

**Notes:**
- Public booking now shows Home-enabled Public services for the selected branch.
- In-spa filtering, active-service filtering, branch scope, public visibility, branch price, branch duration, provider/date/payment/confirmation flow, and UI layout were preserved.
- No dummy services or hardcoded service names were added.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: Passing.
- `pnpm lint`: Passing.
- `pnpm build`: Passing, 80 routes.
- Public API smoke confirmed 6 Home-eligible public services and 3 non-Home services for the Cradle branch.
- Public `/book` smoke returned HTTP 200 OK.

### 2026-05-20 — Codex (BOOKING-MOBILE-SERVICE-GRID-001 — Mobile Booking Service Grid Patch)

**Task:** Patch the public booking wizard service selection UI so mobile service cards remain in a compact responsive grid with no page-level horizontal overflow.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/public/booking-service-picker.tsx`
  - Added stricter mobile card/grid containment (`w-full`, `min-w-0`, `max-w-full`, `overflow-hidden`).
  - Kept the compact image-top mobile card with `aspect-[4/3]`, responsive `next/image` sizes, and meaningful service alt text.
  - Constrained mobile category chip and loading skeleton rows so only the chip row scrolls horizontally.
  - Preserved live service data, category filtering, selected service state, and desktop card layout.
- `src/components/public/booking-wizard.tsx`
  - Added public mobile `w-full max-w-full overflow-x-hidden` wrappers.
  - Added `min-w-0` to the wizard content grid/main column to avoid layout-induced horizontal scroll.
  - Preserved booking flow logic, sticky/fixed action controls, desktop layout, and the floating circular widget.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: Passing.
- `pnpm lint`: Passing.
- `pnpm build`: Passing, 80 routes.
- Browser smoke test on `/book`: 360px -> 2-column grid, 390px/430px -> 3-column grid, 520px -> 4-column grid, 768px/desktop -> desktop layout, all with document-level horizontal overflow `0`.

### 2026-05-18 — Claude (BOOKING-PROVIDER-001 — Smart Provider Selection)

**Task:** Improve booking wizard provider selection so staff are filtered by service, shown as a premium photo grid, and auto-assigned when only one qualified provider is available.

**Problem solved:** The provider step always showed a 2-column initials-avatar grid regardless of how many (or few) providers were qualified. Services with only one qualified provider forced customers to make a trivial "choice." No photos were shown even though staff have `avatar_url` on record.

**Logic (3-case):**
1. **0 providers**: "Any available provider" card + dashed fallback note.
2. **1 provider**: Auto-assigned. Booking card shows provider name, photo, "Available and assigned for you." Customer can tap "Use any available provider instead" (sets `"prefer-auto"` sentinel) to opt out.
3. **2+ providers**: "Any available provider" (Recommended) card on top, then 4-column (2-column mobile) photo grid below. First provider gets a "Recommended" ribbon.

**State model (no useEffect):**
- `selectedStaff: "auto" | "prefer-auto" | staffId` — three semantic values
- `selectedStaffForBooking` useMemo resolves: `"prefer-auto"` → `"auto"`, specific id → validate still available, default `"auto"` + single provider → provider id
- No `setState` inside effects; no cascading renders.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/api/public/booking-context/route.ts` — Added `nickname` and `avatar_url` to primary select string and response mapping; extended `isMissingStaffOrgColumnsError` guard; added `nickname: null` / `avatar_url: null` to legacy fallback map.
- `src/components/public/booking-wizard.tsx` — `BookingContextStaff`, `StaffLookup`, `StaffOption` types updated with `avatarUrl`; `staffAtSlot()` prefers `nickname` over `name` as display; lookup build populates `avatarUrl`; `selectedStaffForBooking` handles 3-case auto-select logic; removed unused `STAFF_TYPE_LABELS` / `StaffType` imports; new `ProviderPhotoCard` component (photo/initials, recommended ribbon, selection ring); `StepTherapist` redesigned with 3 distinct cases; booking summary label updated to "Any available provider".

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 80 routes

### 2026-05-18 — Claude (UI-WARNING-FRAMEWORK-001 — System-Wide Actionable Warning Framework)

**Task:** Create a reusable warning system so every warning in CradleHub is clickable and answers: what is wrong / why it matters / where to fix it / what happens on click.

**Problem solved:** Ad-hoc inline warning divs scattered across the app were non-interactive, had inconsistent styling, and gave no guidance on how to fix the issue. Managers had to navigate manually after seeing a warning.

**Architecture:**
- Type-discriminated `WarningActionType` drives a unified click handler: `scroll` → DOM smooth-scroll, `focus` → DOM focus+scroll, `navigate` → `router.push`, `open-panel`/`modal`/`custom` → `onAction(warning)` callback.
- Severity palette (danger/warning/success/info) matches all existing inline divs exactly — visual parity guaranteed.
- `warningTargets` factory pattern: pre-built targets for every known context (staff, scheduling, branches, services, bookings, dispatch, notifications, settings). Import only what you need; tree-shaking removes the rest.
- `compact` mode: collapses icon + description + impact to just title + action button for dense list contexts.

**Files Created:**
- `src/types/warnings.ts` — Core types: `WarningSeverity`, `WarningActionType`, `ActionableWarningTarget` (discriminated union of 6 types), `ActionableWarning`
- `src/lib/warnings/scroll-to-target.ts` — DOM helpers: `scrollToElement(id)`, `focusElement(id)`, `buildHref(href, tab?, query?)` (SSR-safe with `typeof window === "undefined"` guards)
- `src/lib/warnings/action-targets.ts` — `warningTargets` const object: 25+ factory functions covering all known CradleHub contexts (staff workspace, scheduling, branches, services, bookings, dispatch, notifications, settings, generic scroll/focus/custom)
- `src/components/shared/actionable-warning.tsx` — `ActionableWarning` card component. Severity-themed. Lucide icon wrapped in `<span>` (type-safe). `→` chevron on navigate targets. `aria-label` on action button, `role="alert|status"` on container.
- `src/components/shared/actionable-warning-list.tsx` — `ActionableWarningList` vertical stack. Renders nothing when empty.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/features/staff/staff-approval-workspace.tsx` — Reference integration: replaced 7 inline warning divs with `ActionableWarning` (protected-account danger, zero-services warning, missing-services info in ServiceSummaryCard; awaiting-approval, services warning/success, draft-saved success, save-result in ApprovalSummaryPanel). Added `id="approval-actions"` for scroll target. Added `onAction` prop to `ApprovalSummaryPanel` and wired `panelId === "service-editor"` → `setIsSheetOpen(true)`.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 80 routes

### 2026-05-18 — Claude (BOOKING-SERVICES-001 — Premium Image-Card Services Step)

**Task:** Replace the text-card service list in the public booking wizard with portrait image cards grouped by category.

**Problem solved:** The services step rendered each service as a flat horizontal text row — functional but low-premium. The new design uses 4/5-aspect-ratio portrait photo cards with spa imagery, dark gradient overlays, and a +/✓ selection indicator — consistent with the ProviderPhotoCard aesthetic from BOOKING-PROVIDER-001.

**Design:**
- **Card**: `button` with `aspectRatio: "4/5"`, `next/image fill`, `object-cover`, `group-hover:scale-105`
- **Gradient**: `from-black/80 via-black/20 to-black/10` (bottom-heavy for text legibility)
- **Selection ring**: golden (`ring-[#C8A96B]`) when selected, neutral when not; +/✓ indicator top-right
- **Text panel** pinned to bottom: service name (line-clamp-2), duration faded left, price in gold right
- **Images**: category-name keyword mapping to `SPA_IMAGES` constants (no per-service DB column)

**Architecture:**
- `CATEGORY_IMAGE_KEYWORDS` array — ordered keyword list maps category name substrings to `SPA_IMAGES` paths
- `getCategoryImage(categoryName)` — pure function, first-match wins, falls back to `SPA_IMAGES.booking`
- `ServiceImageCard` — self-contained sub-component, receives pre-resolved `categoryImage`
- All grouping, category sidebar, selection toggle, totals, visit-type filtering: unchanged
- Loading skeleton updated to `grid grid-cols-2` with `aspect-ratio: 4/5` skeletons

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/public/booking-service-picker.tsx` — full rewrite of card rendering; logic layer untouched

### 2026-05-20 — Claude (STAFF-MOTION-001 — Premium Micro-Animations for Staff Portal Booking Progress Actions)

**Task:** Add tiny premium interaction feedback to the existing staff portal booking progress actions without changing the booking lifecycle, business logic, or UI layout.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/shared/motion/premium-action-overlay.tsx` — reusable full-screen cream translucent overlay with forest-green spinner and short action title/description; shown while a server action is in-flight.
- `src/components/shared/motion/premium-success-toast.tsx` — fixed bottom-center slide-up toast for success (green), warning (amber, used for no-show), and error (red) feedback; auto-dismissed by parent via setTimeout.
- `src/components/shared/motion/premium-inline-spinner.tsx` — 13px circular spinner with white borders for use inside the green primary action button.
- `src/components/shared/motion/live-pulse-indicator.tsx` — small animated pulse dot + label; used when booking is in `travel_started` (green) or `session_started` (gold) states.
- `src/components/shared/motion/motion-status-dot.tsx` — animated status dot replacing the plain colored span in the compact stepper: done=green, active=gold pulse, pending=muted, warning=amber.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/booking-progress-actions.tsx` — added `actionFeedback` state, `getProgressFeedback()` helper, `PremiumActionOverlay` during server action, `PremiumSuccessToast`/error toast replacing `alert()`, inline spinner in buttons, `active:scale-[0.98]` press effect, `MotionStatusDot` in stepper, `LivePulseIndicator` next to timers for active travel/session states.
- `src/app/globals.css` — appended four named keyframes: `cradle-premium-pulse` (pulse ring for active dots), `cradle-soft-slide-up` (toast entrance), `cradle-check-pop` (icon pop-in), `cradle-card-glow` (ambient glow, available for future use).

**Notes:**
- No booking lifecycle logic was changed. `progress.ts` and `actions.ts` are untouched.
- No UI redesign: card layouts, desktop/mobile split, and booking card structure unchanged.
- No new npm packages installed. Animations use Tailwind `animate-spin` and custom CSS keyframes only.
- Existing staff portal flow (home-service and in-spa lifecycles, no-show) remains intact.

### 2026-05-20 — Claude (CRM-NAV-001 — CRM Services Access + Nav Fixes)

**Task:** CRM and CSR Head roles were missing the Services page in their workspace. Fixed role guards, created the CRM services route, expanded branch-action authorization, and corrected a duplicate nav item.

**Files Created:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/services/page.tsx` — CRM-scoped services page using same `ServicesOfferedTab` component as manager, but with `CRM_SERVICE_ROLES` set (owner, manager, assistant_manager, store_manager, crm, csr_head); redirects to `/crm` on unauthorized.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/branches/actions.ts` — `requireOwnerOrBranchManager()` now includes `crm` and `csr_head` roles; added `revalidatePath("/manager/services")` and `revalidatePath("/crm/services")` to `removeBranchServiceAction`, `addBranchServiceAction`, and `updateBranchServiceEligibilityAction`.
- `src/components/features/dashboard/nav-config.ts` — added `{ label: "Services", href: "/crm/services", icon: "Sparkles" }` to `CRM_NAV_ITEMS` and `CSR_HEAD_NAV_ITEMS`; removed duplicate "My Schedule" from `STAFF_NAV_ITEMS`.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing

### 2026-05-20 — Claude (MANAGER-STAFF-AVAILABILITY-001 — Manager Staff Availability Setup Page)

**Task:** Create a production-ready manager page for setting weekly working hours, day overrides, day off, and blocked time per staff member. The booking engine already respects `staff_schedules`, `schedule_overrides`, and `blocked_times` — this page exposes management of those tables to the manager.

**Route:** `/manager/staff-availability`

**Files Created:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/staff-availability/page.tsx` — Server component. Uses `getManagerBranchId()` for auth, `getStaffWithAvailability(branchId)` for data, renders `PageHeader` + `StaffSchedulePageClient`. Shows `Alert` on load error.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/queries/staff.ts` — added `StaffAvailabilityItem` type, `buildAvailabilityItems()` helper (parallel fetch of schedules/overrides/blocked_times for all branch staff), and `getStaffWithAvailability(branchId)` export. Includes graceful fallback for older DB schemas missing `staff_type`/`is_head`/`nickname` columns. Fetches overrides and blocked times scoped to next 90 days.
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/staff-weekly-hours-editor.tsx` — added optional `onSave?: () => void` prop; called after successful schedule save.
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/staff-day-overrides-editor.tsx` — added optional `onSave?: () => void` prop; called after successful override save.
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/staff-block-time-editor.tsx` — added optional `onSave?: () => void` prop; called after successful blocked-time save.
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/staff-schedule-detail-panel.tsx` — added `onSave?: () => void` prop; threaded down to each editor tab.
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/staff-schedule-page-client.tsx` — wired `PremiumSuccessToast` (from existing motion library) to fire when any editor tab saves; toast shows staff member's name and auto-dismisses after 3.5 s. Added `useCallback` for `handleSave`.
- `src/components/features/dashboard/nav-config.ts` — added `{ label: "Availability", href: "/manager/staff-availability", icon: "CalendarClock" }` to `MANAGER_NAV_ITEMS` (after "Staff").
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/staff/actions.ts` — all four server actions (`setStaffScheduleAction`, `createScheduleOverrideAction`, `deleteBlockedTimeAction`, `deleteScheduleOverrideAction`) now also call `revalidatePath("/manager/staff-availability")`.

**Design decisions:**
- Route at `/manager/staff-availability` (not `/manager/staff/schedule`) to avoid route conflict with `/manager/staff/[staffId]` dynamic segment.
- All staff in branch visible (active and inactive) so manager can set availability before re-activating staff.
- Editors keep existing inline inline-banner feedback for immediate response; `PremiumSuccessToast` adds a global confirmation at the page level.
- No DB schema changes. No new npm packages. Booking lifecycle logic untouched.

- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 82 app routes

### 2026-05-20 — Codex (SCHEDULE-ADJUSTMENT-001 — Manual Staff Schedule Adjustment)

**Task:** Added a compact manual staff schedule adjustment control to the existing Manager/CRM schedule workflow.

**Files Created:**
- `src/lib/actions/staff-schedule-adjustments.ts` — shared `adjustStaffScheduleAction` with RBAC, branch scope, date override/block CRUD, and schedule/bookings/booking-page revalidation.
- `src/components/features/schedule/manual-staff-schedule-adjustment.tsx` — compact staff-mode adjustment UI for custom hours, day off, block time, clear override, and remove block.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-workspace.tsx` — added schedule-adjustment toast feedback and refresh after successful adjustments.
- `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-board-panel.tsx` — threaded adjustment feedback into staff view mode.
- `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-staff-mode.tsx` — added the manual adjustment section below the selected staff summary.
- `src/lib/queries/schedule.ts` — enriched daily schedule rows with current date override and real blocked-time IDs for safe removal.
- `src/lib/permissions.ts` — added `canAdjustStaffSchedule()` for owner/manager/assistant manager/store manager/CRM/CSR head schedule edits.
- `.context/CURRENT_TASK.cmd.md`, `.context/HANDOFF.cmd.md`, `.context/ERRORS.cmd.md`, `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` — updated agent context.

**Notes:**
- Manager/CRM can now adjust one staff member's availability from `/manager/schedule` and `/crm/schedule` staff mode.
- Weekly schedules remain intact; custom hours/day off are date-specific overrides.
- Booking availability and assignment continue to use the existing availability engine, which already prioritizes overrides/blocks before weekly schedules.
- No database schema changes, new packages, UI redesign, or scheduling engine rewrite.

- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 83 app routes

### 2026-05-21 — Claude Code

**Task:** CRM-OPS-001 — Exposed categorized CRM operations navbar and fixed CRM landing route

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/dashboard/nav-config.ts` — Added `NavGroup` type; replaced flat `CRM_NAV_ITEMS`, `CSR_HEAD_NAV_ITEMS`, `CSR_STAFF_NAV_ITEMS` with grouped nav configs using 5 operational categories
- `src/components/features/dashboard/sidebar.tsx` — Extracted `NavLink` helper, added grouped nav rendering (renders category labels + items when `nav.groups` is set; falls back to flat `nav.items` for owner/manager/staff — no breaking changes), added `CalendarClock` to icon map
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/page.tsx` — Changed CRM landing redirect from `/crm/today` to `/crm/control`

**CRM Nav Categories Added:**
1. Main Operations — Control, Live Map, Dispatch, Bookings, Schedule, Availability
2. Customer Management — Customers, Repeats, Lapsed, Waitlist
3. Service & Resource Setup — Services, Spaces
4. Staff & Internal Work — Staff Applications, Notifications
5. Finance / End-of-day — Reconciliation

**Design Decisions:**
- Used existing route paths (`/crm/live-operations`, `/crm/staff-availability`, `/crm/spaces-rules`) with cleaner display labels to avoid unnecessary redirect pages
- Grouped nav only applies to CRM roles; owner/manager/staff remain flat (backward compatible)
- `NavGroup` type added to `WorkspaceNav`; `items` made optional so the type supports both flat and grouped configs

**Roadmap Items Completed:** Phase 1 CRM operations navigation stabilization

**Notes:** Worked directly on `main`; no branch/worktree created. All 15 required CRM pages already existed — no placeholder pages needed. No scheduling/dispatch business logic changed. No new packages installed. No database or RLS changes.

**Build Status:** ✅ Passing — 83 app routes

### 2026-05-21 — Claude Code

**Task:** CRM-OPS-002A — Audited shift-aware schedule and availability foundation

**Files Created:**
- `docs/phase-2-shift-aware-availability-audit.md` — Technical audit covering schedule model, availability engine, CRM pages, dispatch readiness, staff capability mapping, and Phase 2B–2D implementation plan

**Key Findings:**
- `staff_schedules` UNIQUE `(staff_id, day_of_week)` blocks opening+closing shift support

- No staff check-in/check-out table exists
- `getAvailableBranchDrivers()` is not schedule-aware
- Real `/crm/availability` live view can be built from existing data (no new tables needed for Phase 2B)

**Roadmap Items Completed:** Phase 2A audit — shift-aware availability foundation

**Notes:** Audit only. No new tables, no migrations, no engine changes, no UI rewrites. All findings documented in audit doc.

**Build Status:** ✅ Passing — 83 app routes (no code changed)

### 2026-05-21 — Claude Code (CRM-OPS-002B — CRM Live Availability Dashboard)

**Task:** Create the `/crm/availability` live availability dashboard from existing data (no schema changes).

**Files Created:**
- `src/lib/queries/crm-availability.ts` — `getCrmAvailabilitySnapshot()` combining `getDailySchedule` + `getStaffByBranch`; builds `liveStatus`, `scheduleStatus`, `is_driver`, summary counts
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/availability/page.tsx` — Server component at `/crm/availability`
- `src/components/features/crm/availability/crm-availability-summary.tsx` — 6 stat cards (Scheduled / Available / Busy / Off / No Schedule / Drivers Ready)
- `src/components/features/crm/availability/crm-availability-board.tsx` — Staff availability grid rows
- `src/components/features/crm/availability/crm-availability-client.tsx` — Tabbed client: All Staff / Service Providers / Drivers / Schedule Issues

### 2026-05-21 — Claude Code (CRM-OPS-002E — Schedule Setup Universal Group UI)

**Task:** Redesign `/crm/staff-availability` into a professional Schedule Setup workspace with universal group schedules and individual adjustments.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/schedule-setup-workspace.tsx` — Main tabbed orchestrator (General Rules / Individual Adjustments / Overrides / Coverage Issues)
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/schedule-setup-helper-bar.tsx` — Bottom "How it works" helper bar
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/schedule-overrides-view.tsx` — Overrides tab content (day-off overrides + blocked times summaries)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/staff-availability/page.tsx` — Replaced inline explainer cards with `ScheduleSetupWorkspace`; added page actions (Coverage Overview / Publish Schedules placeholders)

**Pre-existing untracked components brought into the workspace:**
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/schedule-group-cards.tsx` — Horizontal staff group cards with real computed counts
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/group-schedule-rules-panel.tsx` — Universal rules panel with shift templates, weekly pattern matrix, schedule summary, overlap window
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/schedule-setup-right-rail.tsx` — Group overview, coverage insight bars, quick actions
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/schedule-coverage-issues.tsx` — Coverage issues list (no schedule, no opening, on leave)

**Design Decisions:**
- Existing individual schedule editing (`StaffSchedulePageClient`) preserved under the "Individual Adjustments" tab.
- No new database schema introduced — universal schedule persistence is UI-shell only with clear placeholder messaging.
- Real computed staff counts used in group cards and right rail; no fake data.
- Responsive: group cards scroll horizontally on mobile; right rail stacks below main content.

### 2026-05-21 — Claude Code (CRM-OPS-002E-A — Individual Adjustments UI Polish)

**Task:** Redesign the Individual Adjustments tab inside Schedule Setup for better scannability, cleaner filters, status chips, and summary stats.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/staff-schedule-page-client.tsx` — Added horizontal stat strip (Total Staff, Scheduled, Not Scheduled, With Overrides, With Blocks, Inactive) computed from real data.
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/staff-schedule-toolbar.tsx` — Replaced filter dropdown with filter pills/chips; improved search input focus ring; added custom select arrow; cleaner layout.
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/staff-schedule-list.tsx` — Polished table header with warm background; better column proportions; centered override/block columns.
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/staff-schedule-row.tsx` — Added colored avatars; `StatusChip` component (Scheduled/Off/Inactive as pill badges); `CountBadge` for overrides/blocks; `ShiftBadge` uses uppercase pill style; "Manage" button upgraded to `cs-btn-secondary`; hover states preserved.

**Design Decisions:**
- All stats are computed from real `items` prop — no fake data.
- Existing `StaffScheduleDetailPanel` sheet editor is untouched.
- Filter pills are clickable buttons with active/hover states matching CradleHub sand theme.
- Status chips use existing `--cs-success`, `--cs-neutral`, `--cs-error` tokens.

  - Inline edit mode with time inputs and icon buttons (Check/X)
  - Wrapped in a rounded white card
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/staff-day-overrides-editor.tsx` — Redesigned:
  - Add-override form in a rounded white card with labeled fields
  - Day off checkbox, From/To time inputs
  - Override list items as cards with date circle, formatted date, day-off or time range
  - Remove button with Trash icon
  - Empty state with centered icon
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/staff-block-time-editor.tsx` — Redesigned:
  - Add-block form in a rounded white card with labeled fields

### 2026-05-21 — Claude Code (CRM-OPS-002I — Driver/Therapist Assignment Recommendation)

**Task:** Add recommendation engine that helps CRM choose the best available staff for bookings.

**Files Created:**
- `src/lib/assignments/recommendation-engine.ts` — Pure scoring logic for therapist and driver candidates
  - `scoreTherapistCandidates()` — scores service providers by check-in, conflicts, capability, schedule fit, workload
  - `scoreDriverCandidates()` — scores drivers by check-in, active trips, schedule fit, workload
  - Transparent scoring: +40 checked in, +30 no conflict, +20 same branch/service-capable, +15 inside shift, +10 light workload, -50 not checked in/conflict, -30 blocked/day off, -20 no schedule
- `src/lib/queries/assignment-recommendations.ts` — Query layer that fetches all recommendation context in parallel
  - Booking, service, staff list, staff_services, schedules, overrides, blocked times, check-ins, conflict bookings, preferences
- `src/lib/actions/assignment-recommendations.ts` — Server actions
  - `getAssignmentRecommendationsAction()` — full therapist + driver recommendations
  - `getTherapistRecommendationsAction()` — therapist only
  - `getDriverRecommendationsAction()` — driver only (home service only)
  - Branch-scoped with owner cross-branch bypass
- `src/components/features/assignments/assignment-recommendation-card.tsx` — Single candidate card
  - Status badge (recommended/available/warning/unavailable), score, reasons, warnings, assign button
- `src/components/features/assignments/assignment-recommendation-panel.tsx` — Expandable panel
  - "Get Recommendations" button, best match + alternatives, loading/error states

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/bookings/bookings-table.tsx`
  - Added `BookingRecommendationSection` inside `BookingDetailsPanel`
  - Shows therapist recommendations when staff is unassigned
  - Shows driver recommendations for home-service bookings
  - Wires existing `assignBookingDriverAction` for driver assign
  - Shows "Recommendation only" note for therapist (no existing assign action in panel)
- `src/components/features/dispatch/dispatch-workspace.tsx`
  - Added driver recommendation panel inside expanded `DispatchItemRow` when `dispatchStatus === "awaiting_driver"`
  - Wires existing `assignBookingDriverAction`

**Design Decisions:**
- Recommendation-only: no auto-assignment. CRM must still click existing assign/confirm controls.
- Therapist assignment in booking panel is recommendation-only because no existing "assign therapist to booking" UI action exists in the detail panel (assignment happens during booking creation via seniority auto-assign or edit booking flow).
- Driver assignment uses the existing `assignBookingDriverAction` server action.
- Group schedule rules exist but are not integrated into the recommendation engine's schedule check yet (uses `staff_schedules` directly, same as availability engine).
- `staff_scheduling_preferences` is queried but not yet used in scoring (graceful fallback if table absent).

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 84 app routes

**Commit:** `feat(assignments): add staff recommendation engine` on `main`

### 2026-05-21 — Claude Code (Phase 2X-A — Operations Unification Audit)

**Task:** CRM-OPS-002X-A — Audit the entire operations workflow for duplication, broken links, and missing integration points.

**Files Changed:**
- `docs/phase-2x-operations-unification-audit.md` — Created: full audit document
- `.context/CURRENT_TASK.cmd.md` — Updated to 2X-A
- `.context/HANDOFF.cmd.md` — Updated with audit findings and 2X-B+ plan

**Key Findings:**
- CRITICAL: `staff_group_schedule_rules` is ignored by all 5 operational schedule consumers (booking engine, recommendation engine, daily schedule RPC, CRM availability, individual editor). Group rules have zero effect on bookings.
- HIGH: `manager/staff-availability` diverged from `crm/staff-availability` — still uses legacy `StaffSchedulePageClient` while CRM has full Phase 2E `ScheduleSetupWorkspace`.
- MEDIUM: `fmt12h()` duplicated in `dispatch-queries.ts` and `dispatch-workspace.tsx`. Shift badge constants in 4 files. Presence badge in 2 files.
- MEDIUM: `/crm/schedule`, `/manager/schedule`, `/owner/schedule` each inline identical auth context setup code.
- LOW: Double booking fetch in `buildDriverRecommendationContext`. 5 separate N+1 staff ID queries in recommendation context builder.

**No code behavior was changed in this audit.**

**Verification:**
- No build needed (docs-only commit)

**Commit:** `docs(ops): audit workflow unification gaps` on `main`

### 2026-05-21 — Claude Code (CRM-OPS-002X-F — Manager Schedule Setup Parity)

**Task:** Make `/manager/staff-availability` use the same full `ScheduleSetupWorkspace` as `/crm/staff-availability`.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/staff-availability/page.tsx` — Rewritten to match CRM page
  - Now imports `ScheduleSetupWorkspace` instead of `StaffSchedulePageClient`
  - Fetches `getScheduleSetupOverview()` in parallel with `getStaffWithAvailability()`
  - Passes `items`, `groups`, `rulesByGroup` to `ScheduleSetupWorkspace`
  - Uses same `PageActions` placeholder buttons as CRM
  - Same title "Schedule Setup" and description
  - Same error handling pattern

**What did NOT change:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/staff-availability/page.tsx` — untouched
- `ScheduleSetupWorkspace` component — no changes needed (already role-agnostic)
- `StaffSchedulePageClient` — still used inside `ScheduleSetupWorkspace` for Individual Adjustments tab
- Branch scoping — still uses `getManagerBranchId()`
- Security — no role guards weakened

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 84 app routes

**Commit:** `refactor(schedule): align manager schedule setup workspace` on `main`

### 2026-05-21 — Claude Code (CRM-OPS-002X-G — Dead Code / Legacy Cleanup)

**Task:** Remove proven unused legacy schedule components after Manager and CRM aligned on `ScheduleSetupWorkspace`.

**Files Deleted:**
- `src/components/features/schedule/staff-schedule-grid.tsx` — **336 lines, completely unreferenced.** Legacy schedule grid component. Not imported by any page, component, or utility. Exported `StaffScheduleGrid` had zero external references.
- `src/components/features/dashboard/schedule-manager.tsx` — **569 lines, completely unreferenced.** Legacy standalone schedule manager that imported old server actions from `@/app/(dashboard)/manager/staff/actions`. Replaced by the newer `staff-schedule-detail-panel.tsx` + `staff-weekly-hours-editor.tsx` + `staff-day-overrides-editor.tsx` + `staff-block-time-editor.tsx` stack. Not imported anywhere.

**What was NOT deleted (intentionally kept):**
- `StaffSchedulePageClient` — still used inside `ScheduleSetupWorkspace` (Individual Adjustments tab).
- `StaffScheduleToolbar` — still used inside `StaffSchedulePageClient`.
- `StaffScheduleDetailPanel` — still used inside `StaffSchedulePageClient`.
- `QUICK_ACTIONS` array in `schedule-setup-right-rail.tsx` — still rendered as user-visible placeholder UI.
- `fmt12h` in `dispatch-queries.ts` — already removed in prior phase.
- `SHIFT_BADGE` / `PresenceBadge` / `PresencePill` — already removed in prior phases.
- All other `staff-schedule/*.tsx` files — all still referenced by at least one consumer.
- `today-kpi-row.tsx`, `customer-create-form.tsx`, `customer-search.tsx`, `role-badge.tsx`, `notification-card.tsx`, `scheduling-rules-form.tsx`, `service-card-skeleton.tsx` — outside Phase 2X-G scope.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 84 app routes

**Commit:** `refactor(ops): remove legacy schedule cleanup` on `main`

### 2026-05-21 — Claude Code (CRM-OPS-002X-H — End-to-End Operations Smoke Test)

**Task:** Verify the full operational workflow from public booking to CRM operations. Test and document results. Apply only small safe fixes.

**Smoke Test Document:**
- `docs/phase-2x-h-end-to-end-smoke-test.md` — Full report with executive summary, build verification, per-route results, gaps, bugs, fixes, and production readiness assessment.

**Critical Bug Found & Fixed:**
- `src/lib/actions/online-booking.ts` — Notification `Promise.all` after booking insert could throw, causing the catch block to return `{ ok: false }` even though the booking already existed in the database. User would see a failure message but the slot was actually taken.
  - **Fix:** Wrapped notification `Promise.all` in a dedicated `try/catch` so notification failures are logged via `logBookingError` but never fail the already-committed booking.

**Medium Bugs Found & Fixed:**
- `src/components/features/bookings/bookings-table.tsx` — Driver assignment in `BookingRecommendationSection` was fire-and-forget (no `await`, no `router.refresh()`). UI stayed showing "No driver assigned" after clicking Assign.
  - **Fix:** Added `async/await` + `router.refresh()` to `onAssignDriver` callback.
- `src/components/features/dispatch/dispatch-workspace.tsx` — Same fire-and-forget driver assignment bug in `DispatchItemRow`.
  - **Fix:** Extracted `DispatchRecommendationPanel` component with `async/await` + `router.refresh()`.

**Minor Fix Applied:**
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/staff-schedule-page.tsx` + `src/app/(dashboard)/staff-portal/schedule/page.tsx` — Removed unused `rawBlocks` prop and `BlockedTimeRow` type import.

**Deferred Issues (documented in smoke test report):**
1. Group schedule `shift_type` not reflected in CRM Live Availability check-in — staff with group rules but no individual schedule get `shift_type: "single"` for check-in, which may not match their group rule.
2. Recommendation engine does not use `max_services_per_day` / `max_trips_per_day` from `staff_scheduling_preferences`.
3. Driver ETA/travel distance not factored into driver recommendations.

**Build Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 84 app routes

**Commit:** `fix(ops): resolve smoke test blockers` on `main`

### 2026-05-24 — Claude Code (CRM Operations Setup Center)

**Task:** CRM-OPS-003 — Build unified CRM Operations Setup Center

**Audit Findings:**
- 20 existing CRM pages covering all operational areas
- Nav already grouped into 5 logical sections (Main Ops, Customer Mgmt, Service & Resource Setup, Staff & Internal Work, Finance)
- All individual setup pages exist: schedule, availability, services, spaces-rules, dispatch, control, live-operations
- Key gap: no unified "operational health" view — CRM must navigate multiple pages to understand what's misconfigured
- Key gap: no "Setup Issues" checklist — no way to see broken configuration at a glance

**Files Created:**
- `src/lib/queries/crm-setup.ts` — `getCrmSetupHealth()` query: checks service staff schedules, staff_services assignments, booking rules, resources, drivers, unassigned bookings
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/setup/page.tsx` — Operations Setup Center page (`/crm/setup`)
- `src/components/features/crm/setup/crm-setup-health-cards.tsx` — 6 health status cards (ready/warning/error/info)
- `src/components/features/crm/setup/crm-setup-issues-list.tsx` — actionable issues checklist (severity-sorted, linked to fix pages)
- `src/components/features/crm/setup/crm-setup-workspace-tiles.tsx` — tiles navigating to existing setup pages (no duplication of logic)

**Files Updated:**
- `src/components/features/dashboard/nav-config.ts` — added "Ops Setup" link to CRM and CSR Head "Service & Resource Setup" nav groups
- `src/app/(dashboard)/dev/page.tsx` — added /crm/setup to CRM section in dev panel

**Architecture Decisions Followed:**
- DEC-CRM-001: Used existing route paths — no redirect indirection
- DEC-CRM-002: Grouped nav only for CRM roles — not touched for other workspaces
- No business logic duplicated — all existing queries/pages reused via links
- SERVICE_STAFF_TYPES constant used to filter service-providing staff (therapist, nail_tech, aesthetician, salon_head)
- day_of_week: 0=Sunday (JS getDay() convention, matches staff_schedules DB column)

**What the Setup Center Checks:**
1. Service staff with individual schedule rows (for today's day_of_week)
2. Active branch services with at least one staff_services assignment
3. Active branch_resources count
4. Whether custom branch_booking_rules exist (vs system defaults)
5. Home service enabled + drivers available
6. Unassigned confirmed bookings for today

**Build Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 85 app routes (added /crm/setup)

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-SAFE-TWEAKS-001 — CRM Safe Usability Tweaks)

**Task:** CRM safe usability tweaks before full CRM setup redesign.
Phase 1 only — small, regression-resistant changes. No booking logic changed.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/page.tsx` — changed /crm redirect from /crm/control → /crm/today
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/availability/page.tsx` — clarified live availability vs online booking; notice now explicitly states online booking remains schedule-based and is not controlled by the check-in board
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/bookings/new/page.tsx` — reads `type` query param (walkin | home_service), derives initialVisitType and passes it to BookingWizard; also updates page title/description dynamically
- `src/components/public/booking-wizard.tsx` — added optional `initialVisitType?: VisitType` prop; initializes bookingType state from it (falls back to "in_spa" when omitted — no change to public booking behavior)
- `src/components/features/crm/today/today-quick-actions.tsx` — replaced 4 generic actions with 5 CRM-focused quick actions: New Walk-in, New Home Service, Online Requests, Search Customer, Live Availability
- `src/components/features/crm/today/today-staff-readiness.tsx` — fixed "Full View" link from /crm/staff-availability → /crm/availability
- `src/components/features/dashboard/nav-config.ts` — renamed "Ops Setup" → "Rules & Setup" and "Spaces" → "Spaces & Rules" in CRM_NAV_GROUPS and CSR_HEAD_NAV_GROUPS

**Files NOT Changed (confirmed):**
- src/lib/actions/online-booking.ts — untouched
- src/lib/actions/inhouse-booking.ts — untouched
- src/lib/engine/availability.ts — untouched
- src/lib/engine/resource-availability.ts — untouched
- src/lib/bookings/dispatch-conflict.ts — untouched
- src/lib/bookings/dispatch-slot-filter.ts — untouched
- No database schema changes. No migrations.

**Architecture Note (to carry forward):**
Online booking remains strictly schedule-based.
CRM/in-house booking can use daily staff check-in and live resource readiness.
Home-service booking keeps its dispatch/location workflow.
All three flows share the scheduling/availability engine but apply it differently based on booking context.

**Build Status:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ PASS
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ PASS
- `pnpm build`: ✅ PASS, 85 app routes

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-TODAY-PHASE2-001 — Daily Operations Center UI)

**Task:** Phase 2 CRM Today Daily Operations Center UI organization.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/today/page.tsx` — title changed to "Daily Operations Center"; added TodayWorkflowStrip, "Serve Customers" section label, "Today's Operational Snapshot" section label, TodaySystemMatchStatus, TodayEmergencyActions; retained all existing components
- `src/components/features/crm/today/crm-booking-queue-panel.tsx` — improved empty-state message for active tab
- `src/components/features/crm/today/today-staff-readiness.tsx` — added "Start Day" label and description inside the card
- `src/components/features/crm/today/today-quick-actions.tsx` — removed self-owned marginBottom (now owned by section wrapper)
- `src/components/features/crm/today/today-priority-strip.tsx` — removed self-owned marginBottom (now owned by section wrapper)

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/crm/today/today-workflow-strip.tsx` — visual shift workflow guide (Start Day → Serve Customers → Confirm Bookings → Monitor Operations → Emergency Actions)
- `src/components/features/crm/today/today-system-match-status.tsx` — orientation card linking to 6 operational tools (no new queries, navigation only)
- `src/components/features/crm/today/today-emergency-actions.tsx` — mid-shift action links card (navigation only)

**Notes:**
- Reorganized /crm/today around the daily front-desk workflow.
- Added workflow strip, System Match Status, and Emergency Actions.
- No booking business logic changed.
- Online booking remains schedule-based.
- In-house CRM booking remains live-operations based.
- Home-service workflow remains dispatch/location based.
- No new database queries or schema changes.
- All links in new components point to existing CRM routes — no invented routes.

**Build Status:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ PASS
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ PASS
- `pnpm build`: ✅ PASS, 85 app routes

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-SETUP-PHASE3-001 — Rules & Setup Center)

**Task:** Phase 3 CRM Rules & Setup Center.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/setup/page.tsx` — title changed to "Rules & Setup Center"; Section helper upgraded with description prop; 5-section layout: Booking Flow Rules, Setup Health, Setup Issues, Setup Workspaces, What affects each booking type?; both informational-only sections render even on health-check error; footer updated with online-booking architecture note
- `src/components/features/crm/setup/crm-setup-workspace-tiles.tsx` — TILES array updated to match Phase 3 required 6 workspaces: Services & Therapists, Schedule Setup, Spaces & Rules, Live Availability, Dispatch, Daily Operations Center

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/crm/setup/crm-booking-flow-rules.tsx` — 3-card grid (Online Booking/Schedule-based, In-House/Live operations, Home-Service/Dispatch workflow) with badge, description, and 3 quick links each; informational/navigation only
- `src/components/features/crm/setup/crm-booking-impact-matrix.tsx` — responsive table (overflow-x: auto) with 10 data-factor rows × 3 booking-type columns; ✓/✕/partial-note cells; informational only

**Files Untouched (reused as-is):**
- `src/components/features/crm/setup/crm-setup-health-cards.tsx`
- `src/components/features/crm/setup/crm-setup-issues-list.tsx`
- `src/lib/queries/crm-setup.ts`

**Notes:**
- Converted /crm/setup into Rules & Setup Center.
- Added booking flow rules explanation (3 cards, badges, quick links).
- Added booking impact matrix (10 factors × 3 booking types).
- Preserved existing setup health and setup issues components untouched.
- No booking logic changed.
- Online booking remains schedule-based.
- In-house booking remains live-operations based.
- Home-service remains dispatch/location based.

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-SERVICES-PHASE4-001)

**Task:** Phase 4 — /crm/services → "Services & Therapist Setup"

**Files Added:**
- `src/lib/queries/crm-services.ts` — `getBranchStaffAndServiceAssignments(branchId, serviceIds)`: parallel fetch of active branch staff + staff_services rows for the provider panel
- `src/components/features/crm/services/crm-service-therapist-panel.tsx` — `CrmServiceTherapistPanel`: read-only per-service provider assignment view with warning/critical states

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/services/page.tsx`
  - Title: "Services" → "Services & Therapist Setup" (icon: ✨)
  - Added `isActiveBranchService` type guard
  - Fetches providerStaff + providerAssignments after branch services (non-fatal: panel shows empty if fails)
  - Two sections: Active Services + Provider Assignments

**Key Decisions:**
- Provider Assignments panel is read-only for CRM workspace — assignment editing stays in owner workspace (owner → Staff → [member] → Services tab)
- `SERVICE_STAFF_TYPES = ["therapist", "nail_tech", "aesthetician", "salon_head"]` — only these count as valid providers
- `HARD_EXCLUDED_SYSTEM_ROLES = ["driver", "utility"]` — never shown as providers even if staff_services row exists
- ⛔ critical = public service + 0 valid providers (online booking affected)
- ⚠️ warning = non-public service + 0 valid providers (CRM bookings affected)
- Panel footnote explains the matching rule and links to /owner/staff for edits

**Notes:**
- No booking logic changed. No DB schema changes. No new migrations.
- The `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` tsconfig flag required using inline object fallbacks for Record<string, T> access (not `record[key] ?? record.defaultKey` pattern).

**Build Status:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: ✅ PASS (0 errors)
- Commit: 79dd447

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-SERVICES-PHASE4B-001)

**Task:** Phase 4B — CRM-managed therapist-service assignments with guardrails

**Files Added:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/services/actions.ts`
  - `assignProviderToServiceAction`: role guard → branch scope → service-active → staff-eligible (SERVICE_STAFF_TYPES, HARD_EXCLUDED_SYSTEM_ROLES, is_active) → no-duplicate → inserts staff_services row
  - `removeProviderFromServiceAction`: same guards + last-provider protection (blocks removal that would leave a public active service with 0 valid providers)
  - `requireCrmSetupAccess()`: context helper for CRM_SETUP_ROLES (owner, manager, assistant_manager, store_manager, crm, csr_head)
  - Zod validation for all inputs
  - Revalidates /crm/services, /crm/setup, /crm/today after mutations
- `src/components/features/crm/services/provider-assignment-card.tsx`
  - Client component per service: assign dropdown (pre-filtered to valid/unassigned/active providers only), ✕ remove buttons per chip, inline status feedback, router.refresh() on success
- `src/components/features/crm/services/types.ts`
  - ServiceRow shared type (server panel + client card)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/features/crm/services/crm-service-therapist-panel.tsx`
  - Refactored from client → server component shell
  - Computes ServiceRow[] including assignableProviders per service
  - Renders ProviderAssignmentCard per row
  - MVP access notice added
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/services/page.tsx`
  - Passes branchId prop to CrmServiceTherapistPanel

**Notes:**
- Enabled CRM to assign/remove valid service providers for MVP setup.
- Uses existing staff_services relationship — no duplicate system.
- Validates staff eligibility with SERVICE_STAFF_TYPES and HARD_EXCLUDED_SYSTEM_ROLES.
- Blocks invalid provider roles (drivers, utility, CRM/CSR-only without service staff_type).
- Protects public active services from ending with zero valid providers.
- Assign dropdown excludes: drivers, utility, inactive, already-assigned providers.
- No booking logic changed. Online booking remains schedule-based.
- MVP note: CRM permission is intentionally broad; can be tightened to manager/owner later.
- No database schema changes. No new migrations.

**Build Status:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: ✅ PASS (0 errors)
- `eslint (changed files)`: ✅ PASS (0 warnings)
- Commit: e1c65da

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-AVAILABILITY-PHASE7-001)

**Task:** Phase 7 — /crm/availability → "Live Availability & Check-In Center"

**Files Added:**
- `src/components/features/crm/availability/checkin-explainer.tsx`
  - 3 cards: In-House Operations (amber), Online Booking (blue), Home Service (green)
  - Each card explains the booking flow's relationship to check-in with bullet points
  - Cross-links: Online Booking → Schedule Setup + Spaces & Rules; Home Service → Today
  - Architecture note banner: online booking = schedule-based, not check-in-based
- `src/components/features/crm/availability/start-day-checklist.tsx`
  - 5-step morning readiness checklist (check in arrivals, review missing, confirm drivers,
    check schedule issues, open Today to begin serving)
  - Steps 4 and 5 link to Schedule Setup Center and Daily Operations Center
- `src/components/features/crm/availability/live-availability-impact-card.tsx`
  - "What This Affects" — 4 rows mapping check-in status to each booking flow
  - Online booking: unaffected; In-house + Dispatch: "Uses check-in" badge; Staff readiness: feeds Today
- `src/components/features/crm/availability/availability-related-tools.tsx`
  - 6 footer tool link cards: Today, Schedule Setup, Dispatch, Services, Spaces & Rules, Rules & Setup

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/availability/page.tsx`
  - Title: "Live Availability" → "Live Availability & Check-In Center"
  - Subtitle updated to describe same-day operations scope
  - Added CheckInExplainer after PageHeader
  - Removed old inline check-in awareness notice (explainer covers it more thoroughly)
  - Layout: CheckInExplainer → CrmAvailabilitySummary → CrmAvailabilityClient → StartDayChecklist
    → LiveAvailabilityImpactCard → AvailabilityRelatedTools
  - Added StartDayChecklist, LiveAvailabilityImpactCard, AvailabilityRelatedTools imports

**Notes:**
- All existing check-in / check-out server actions (`checkInStaffForShiftAction`,
  `checkOutStaffForShiftAction`) preserved unchanged.
- `CrmAvailabilityClient` (4-tab board) and `CrmAvailabilitySummary` (7 stat cards)
  preserved exactly as-is — no modifications.
- No booking logic changed. No DB schema changes. No new migrations.
- Online booking remains strictly schedule-based and is unaffected by this board.

**Build Status:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: ✅ PASS (0 errors)
- `eslint (changed files)`: ✅ PASS (0 warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ PASS (85/85 routes)
- Commit: 3375c1f

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-READINESS-PHASE9A-001)

**Task:** Phase 9A — Audit Existing Readiness & Condition Checks

**Files Added:**
- `docs/CRM_READINESS_AUDIT.md`
  - Full codebase audit of all readiness/health/warning/issue/notification logic
  - Section A: Readiness system map (8 CRM pages/features, each with queries, components, data shapes)
  - Section B: All 7 distinct severity/issue type systems with full TypeScript shapes
  - Section C: Reusable component candidates (ActionableWarning, ActionableWarningList as gold standard)
  - Section D: 8 cases of duplicate logic with source-of-truth recommendations
  - Section E: 14 missing condition checks with severity and suggested fix links
  - Section F: Proposed ReadinessIssue + ReadinessSeverity + ReadinessScope canonical types
  - Section G: 7-phase implementation plan (9B–9G)
  - Section H: Do-not-touch files list
  - Section I: Summary table across all CRM pages

**Files Changed:**
- `.context/CURRENT_TASK.cmd.md` — updated to Phase 9A COMPLETE
- `.context/CHANGELOG.cmd.md` — this entry
- `.context/HANDOFF.cmd.md` — Phase 9A summary added

**Key Audit Findings:**
- 7 different severity type systems in use (`"danger"/"error"/"critical"` all mean the same thing but appear in different files)
- `ActionableWarning` in `src/types/warnings.ts` is the most mature shared type and should become the standard
- `getCrmSetupHealth()` in `src/lib/queries/crm-setup.ts` is the only centralized multi-domain aggregator — the model for the future engine
- `CrmSetupIssuesList` is a near-duplicate of `ActionableWarningList` but uses a different data shape
- Staff-no-schedule check appears in 3 independent places; service-no-provider in 2; unassigned bookings in 3
- 14 missing checks identified including: driver-assigned-not-checked-in, home-service-no-therapist, no-opening-shift, ghost-check-in, payment-overdue, booking-no-address

**Notes:**
- No booking logic changed. No DB schema changes. No new migrations.
- No source code files modified — audit document only.

**Build Status:**
- No source changes — build not run (not required)

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-READINESS-PHASE9B-001)

**Task:** Phase 9B — Shared Operations Readiness Types & Components

**Files Added:**
- `src/types/readiness.ts`
  - `ReadinessSeverity` — "critical" | "warning" | "info" | "success"
  - `ReadinessScope` — 8 domains: setup/schedule/daily/service/space/dispatch/payment/system
  - `ReadinessStatus` — "ok" | "warning" | "critical"
  - `ReadinessIssue` — canonical issue shape (id, scope, severity, title, problem, impact, fix, actionLabel, actionHref, source, entityType?, entityIds?, count?)
  - `ReadinessResult` — { issues, status }
  - `ReadinessHealthMetric` — (id, label, value, description?, status?, href?)
  - `getReadinessStatusFromIssues()` — derives status from highest-severity issue
  - `sortReadinessIssues()` — critical → warning → info → success, then alpha by title
  - `buildReadinessResult()` — convenience wrapper
  - `READINESS_SCOPE_META` — icon/label map for all 8 scopes
- `src/components/shared/readiness-issue-card.tsx` — Server component
  - Severity icon + badge label, scope badge with icon, count badge (when >1)
  - Full detail: title, problem, impact, fix, action Link
  - Compact mode: title + action only (hides problem/impact/fix, smaller icon)
  - SEVERITY_STYLE record for color/bg/border per severity level
- `src/components/shared/readiness-issue-list.tsx` — Server component
  - Sorts via sortReadinessIssues (critical first)
  - Empty state: green ✅ banner with configurable title/description
  - Optional section header with issue count badge
  - maxItems cap with "+ N more issues not shown" footer
  - compact prop forwarded to each ReadinessIssueCard
- `src/components/shared/readiness-health-grid.tsx` — Server component
  - Responsive grid (columns prop: 2 | 3 | 4, default 3)
  - Metric card: large value, label, description, "View details ›" link if href present
  - Status colours: critical=red, warning=amber, ok=green, neutral=muted

**Commit:** dbdef68

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing (85/85 routes)

**Notes:**
- No existing CRM pages touched. No booking logic changed. No DB schema changes.
- All new files are Server Components (no "use client"). Uses Link from next/link.
- noUncheckedIndexedAccess safety: ?? fallbacks on all Record indexing.
- Foundation for Phase 9C (aggregator query), 9D (replace duplicate displays), 9E (add missing checks).

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-READINESS-PHASE9C-001)

**Task:** Phase 9C — CRM Operations Readiness Aggregator

**Files Added:**
- `src/lib/queries/crm-readiness.ts`
  - `getCrmReadinessIssues(branchId)` — main aggregator, returns `ReadinessIssue[]`
  - `getCrmReadiness(branchId)` — convenience wrapper, returns `ReadinessResult`
  - `mapSetupIssuesToReadinessIssues()` — maps SetupIssue[] from getCrmSetupHealth
  - `mapStaffReadinessToReadinessIssues()` — maps CrmAvailabilitySummary
  - `mapDispatchStatsToReadinessIssues()` — maps DispatchStats
  - `mapPaymentSummaryToReadinessIssues()` — maps daily payment summary
  - `dedupeReadinessIssues()` — deduplicates by id, keeps highest severity
  - `createSourceFailureIssue()` — emits system:warning when a source fails
  - `mapSetupSeverity()`, `mapSetupScope()`, `deriveSetupFix()` — field mapping helpers

**Existing Checks Mapped:**
  From getCrmSetupHealth (6 issues):
  - no-schedule → setup:no-schedule (schedule / warning)
  - no-staff-for-service → setup:no-staff-for-service (service / critical)
  - no-drivers → setup:no-drivers (dispatch / critical)
  - no-resources → setup:no-resources (space / warning)
  - default-rules → setup:default-rules (setup / info)
  - unassigned-bookings → setup:unassigned-bookings (daily / critical)
  From getCrmTodaySnapshot (5 issues):
  - notCheckedIn → availability:not-checked-in (daily / warning)
  - needsAttention → availability:needs-attention (schedule / warning)
  - no drivers ready → availability:drivers-not-ready (dispatch / warning)
  - awaitingDispatch → dispatch:awaiting-driver (dispatch / warning)
  - unpaid_count → payment:unpaid-bookings (payment / warning)

**Design Decisions:**
  - getCrmTodaySnapshot called once (it internally calls getCrmAvailabilitySnapshot)
    to avoid running availability queries twice
  - Two sources run in parallel via Promise.allSettled (never throws)
  - Source failure emits system:warning issue rather than crashing or silently omitting
  - dedupeReadinessIssues keeps highest severity on ID collision
  - Severity mapping: SetupIssue "error" → "critical", "warning" → "warning", "info" → "info"
  - Scope derived from issue.id via SETUP_SCOPE_MAP lookup with "setup" fallback

**Deferred to Phase 9E:**
  - Service provider public/non-public distinction (requires staff_type filtering)
  - Resource conflict detection (per-booking compute in spaces-rules-utils)
  - Schedule coverage detail (per-staff, schedule-coverage-issues.tsx)
  - 14 missing checks from docs/CRM_READINESS_AUDIT.md Section E

**Notes:**
  - No existing CRM page behavior changed
  - No booking logic changed
  - No DB schema changed
  - Aggregator not wired to UI yet — Phase 9D will wire /crm/setup first

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-READINESS-PHASE9D-001)

**Task:** Phase 9D — Wire /crm/setup to Shared ReadinessIssueList

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/setup/page.tsx`
  - Added `getCrmReadiness` import (Phase 9C aggregator)
  - Added `ReadinessIssueList` import (Phase 9B shared component)
  - Removed `CrmSetupIssuesList` usage (import also removed from page; component file NOT deleted)
  - getCrmSetupHealth and getCrmReadiness now run in parallel via Promise.all
  - getCrmReadiness uses .catch(() => null) so readiness failure never crashes health cards
  - Summary banner: counts + status badge now derived from readiness.issues (full operational picture)
    with getCrmSetupHealth counts as safe fallback when readiness is null
  - Overall status badge (Critical / Warning / OK) added to summary banner
  - "Setup Issues" section renamed to "Readiness Issues" to reflect broader coverage
  - Issues section replaced: CrmSetupIssuesList → ReadinessIssueList
  - Safe fallback message shown when getCrmReadiness unexpectedly returns null
  - CrmSetupHealthCards unchanged — still powered by getCrmSetupHealth
  - All other sections (Booking Flow Rules, Setup Health, Setup Workspaces, Impact Matrix) unchanged

**Intentionally Left Unchanged:**
- `src/components/features/crm/setup/crm-setup-issues-list.tsx` — NOT deleted
- `src/lib/queries/crm-setup.ts` — NOT changed
- All other CRM pages — NOT migrated in this phase
- No booking logic changed

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-READINESS-PHASE9E-A-001)

**Task:** Phase 9E-A — Add Compact System Readiness Strip to /crm/today

**Files Added:**
- `src/components/features/crm/today/today-readiness-strip.tsx`
  - Server component. Props: `{ readiness: ReadinessResult | null }`
  - Header row: section label + status badge (Critical/Warning/All Clear) + count summary + "View all issues ›" → /crm/setup
  - Body: `ReadinessIssueList` with `compact={true}` and `maxItems={3}` (top 3 critical-first issues)
  - Safe fallback card when readiness is null
  - STATUS_STYLE record for color/bg/border per ReadinessStatus

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/today/page.tsx`
  - `getCrmReadiness(branchId).catch(() => null)` added to existing `Promise.all` — no extra round trip; graceful degradation to null if aggregator throws
  - `TodayReadinessStrip` rendered after `TodayWorkflowStrip`, before "Serve Customers" section
  - All existing Today sections unchanged (TodayAttentionStrip, TodayWorkflowStrip, TodayPriorityStrip, TodayStaffReadiness, TodayDispatchSnapshot, TodaySideRail, CrmBookingQueuePanel, TodaySystemMatchStatus, TodayEmergencyActions)

**Intentionally Left Unchanged:**
- TodayPriorityStrip, TodayAttentionStrip — not replaced

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (Phase 9E-B — CRM Services Provider Warnings → ReadinessIssueCard)

**Task:** CRM-READINESS-PHASE9E-B-001 — Migrate hand-rolled provider warning banners in the CRM Services panel to use shared `ReadinessIssueCard` and `ReadinessIssueList` components.

**Files Changed:**

- `src/components/features/crm/services/crm-service-therapist-panel.tsx`
  - Added `ReadinessIssueList` import and `ReadinessIssue` type import
  - Exported `createNoProviderReadinessIssue(row: ServiceRow): ReadinessIssue | null` — maps a no-provider ServiceRow to a ReadinessIssue (critical for public services, warning for internal)
  - Replaced hand-rolled aggregate banner (criticalCount/warningCount div) with `ReadinessIssueList compact` showing one issue per affected service

- `src/components/features/crm/services/provider-assignment-card.tsx`
  - Added `ReadinessIssueCard` import and `ReadinessIssue` type import
  - Added `buildNoProviderIssue(row: ServiceRow): ReadinessIssue | null` local helper (mirrors `createNoProviderReadinessIssue` but self-contained in the client component)
  - Computes `noProviderIssue = buildNoProviderIssue(row)` in component body
  - Replaced old ⛔/⚠️ italic text block with `<ReadinessIssueCard issue={noProviderIssue} compact />` in the else branch of the assigned-providers conditional

**Intentionally Left Unchanged:**
- Assign Provider dropdown (select + Assign button)
- Remove provider chips (ProviderChip + ✕ button)
- Inline StatusMessage (success/error feedback)
- `router.refresh()` on successful action
- `assignProviderToServiceAction` / `removeProviderFromServiceAction` calls
- Last-provider protection (lives in actions.ts)
- No booking logic changed. No DB schema changed. No other CRM pages touched.

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (Phase 9E-C — Schedule Setup Warnings → Shared Readiness Components)

**Task:** CRM-READINESS-PHASE9E-C-001 — Migrate hand-rolled schedule coverage warning banners in /crm/staff-availability to use shared ReadinessIssueCard and ReadinessIssueList components.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/schedule-readiness-utils.ts`
  - Pure helper functions (no React, no server-only APIs): `buildMissingScheduleIssue`, `buildNoGroupOrIndividualIssue`, `buildNoActiveScheduleIssue`, `buildNoOpeningShiftIssue`, `buildOnLeaveTodayIssue`
  - Usable in both server and client component contexts

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/schedule-coverage-issues.tsx`
  - Removed hand-rolled `IssueSection` sub-component (title/description/badge/color div header)
  - Replaced each section header with `ReadinessIssueCard compact` using helpers from utils
  - Kept per-staff `IssueCard` grid below each ReadinessIssueCard (preserves who-is-affected detail)
  - Empty state now uses `ReadinessIssueList` (issues=[], emptyTitle/emptyDescription) for shared styling
  - Issue order: critical (noGroupOrIndividual) → warning (noSchedule) → warning (noOpeningToday) → info (onLeaveToday)
  - Severity mappings: noGroupOrIndividual=critical, noSchedule/noOpeningToday=warning, onLeaveToday=info

- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/schedule-setup-health-summary.tsx`
  - Added imports: `ReadinessIssueCard`, `buildMissingScheduleIssue`
  - Replaced hand-rolled ⚠️ banner div with `<ReadinessIssueCard issue={buildMissingScheduleIssue(stats.missingSchedule)} />` (full/non-compact for context)
  - Stat cards grid unchanged

**Intentionally Left Unchanged:**
- All schedule data computation (noSchedule, noGroupOrIndividual, noOpeningToday, onLeaveToday filters)
- `IssueCard` per-staff detail cards (still show individual staff names with tag badges)
- `ScheduleSetupWorkspace` (4-tab editor), `ScheduleSetupExplainer`, `ScheduleRelatedTools`
- `ManualScheduleImport` wizard and `applyManualScheduleImportAction`
- `schedule-setup-workspace.tsx` — untouched
- No booking logic changed. No DB schema changed. No schedule save actions changed.

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (Phase 9E-E — Spaces & Rules Resource Conflicts → Shared Readiness Components)

**Task:** CRM-READINESS-PHASE9E-E-001 — Migrate hand-rolled resource conflict warnings in /crm/spaces-rules to use shared ReadinessIssueCard and ReadinessIssueList components.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/spaces-rules/spaces-readiness-utils.ts`
  - `mapResourceConflictToReadinessIssue(conflict, index)` — one ReadinessIssue per conflict; conflict.description → problem field (detail preserved); severity from conflict type: missing_assignment=warning, overlap/capacity_overflow=critical
  - `buildConflictSummaryIssues(conflicts)` — aggregates to one summary issue per conflict type; used in OverviewTab alerts section

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/spaces-rules/conflicts-tab.tsx`
  - Removed hand-rolled `ConflictRow` sub-component and lucide-react icon imports (AlertTriangle, CircleDashed, Wrench)
  - Maps all conflicts via `mapResourceConflictToReadinessIssue` then passes to `ReadinessIssueList` (non-compact: problem/impact/fix/action all visible)
  - Empty state uses ReadinessIssueList's built-in emptyTitle/emptyDescription

- `src/components/features/spaces-rules/overview-tab.tsx`
  - Removed custom amber/red alert div blocks + lucide imports (AlertTriangle, CircleDashed)
  - Replaced "Alerts" card content with `ReadinessIssueList compact` fed by `buildConflictSummaryIssues(conflicts)` — shows one card per conflict type with count badge

**Intentionally Left Unchanged:**
- `computeResourceConflicts()` in spaces-rules-utils.ts — all conflict detection logic preserved
- `computeKpiData()`, `ResourceConflict` type, `ResourceRow` — unchanged
- `SpacesRulesHealthSummary` — pure stat cards, no warning banners, untouched
- `SpacesRulesKpiCards` — metric display, untouched
- `spaces-rules-workspace.tsx`, `spaces-tab.tsx`, `booking-rules-tab.tsx` — untouched

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (Phase 9E-G — CRM Availability Warnings → Shared Readiness Components)

**Task:** CRM-READINESS-PHASE9E-G-001 — Migrate needs-attention / live availability warning UI in /crm/availability to shared ReadinessIssueCard and ReadinessIssueList components.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/crm/availability/availability-readiness-utils.ts`
  - `buildAvailabilityReadinessIssues(summary)` — maps CrmAvailabilitySummary → ReadinessIssue[]: notCheckedIn → warning (scope:daily), needsAttention → warning (scope:schedule), driversTotal>0 && driversReady===0 → warning (scope:dispatch)
  - `buildNoScheduleStaffIssue(count)` — single issue for ScheduleIssuesView tab banner

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/availability/page.tsx`
  - Added imports: ReadinessIssueList, buildAvailabilityReadinessIssues
  - Added `<ReadinessIssueList compact>` between CrmAvailabilitySummary and CrmAvailabilityClient; emits issues only when snapshot.summary has notCheckedIn/needsAttention/no-driver-ready; shows "Live availability looks ready" empty state when none

- `src/components/features/crm/availability/crm-availability-client.tsx` (minimal change)
  - Added imports: ReadinessIssueCard, ReadinessIssueList, buildNoScheduleStaffIssue
  - `ScheduleIssuesView` only: replaced description paragraph with `ReadinessIssueCard compact`; replaced custom empty state div with `ReadinessIssueList issues={[]}` empty state; per-staff orange-bordered grid preserved

**Intentionally Left Unchanged:**
- `CrmAvailabilitySummary` stat cards (Scheduled, Checked In, Available, Busy, Not Checked In, Drivers Ready, Needs Attention) — pure metrics, no banner
- `StaffListView` (check-in/check-out buttons untouched)
- `DriverReadinessView` (check-in/check-out buttons untouched)
- `CrmAvailabilityBoard` (live board columns unchanged)
- `getCrmAvailabilitySnapshot` query logic unchanged
- `checkInStaffForShiftAction`, `checkOutStaffForShiftAction` — unchanged
- No booking logic changed. No DB schema changed.

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-READINESS-PHASE9E-F-001)

**Task:** Phase 9E-F — Migrate /crm/dispatch Home-Service Dispatch Warnings to Shared Readiness Components

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/dispatch/dispatch-readiness-utils.ts`
  - `mapDispatchAlertToReadinessIssue(alert)` — maps single DispatchAlert → ReadinessIssue; severity: "danger"→"critical", "warning"→"warning"; scope:"dispatch"; contextual impact+fix per alert title pattern (No Driver Assigned / Location Needs Confirmation / Booking Running Late)
  - `buildAlertIssues(alerts)` — DispatchAlert[] → ReadinessIssue[], preserves order

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/dispatch/dispatch-workspace.tsx` (minimal)
  - Removed `AlertBanner` sub-component (lucide AlertTriangle, amber/red styled divs, return-null-when-empty pattern)
  - Removed `AlertTriangle` from lucide imports
  - Added imports: `ReadinessIssueList`, `buildAlertIssues`
  - Replaced `<AlertBanner alerts={data.alerts} />` with `<ReadinessIssueList issues={buildAlertIssues(data.alerts)} compact emptyTitle="No active dispatch alerts" ...>`

**Intentionally Left Unchanged:**
- `src/lib/bookings/ops-warnings.ts` — OperationalWarning computation untouched
- `src/lib/queries/dispatch-queries.ts` — computeAlerts, getDispatchData untouched
- `src/features/dispatch/types.ts` — DispatchAlert, DispatchStatus untouched
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/dispatch/page.tsx` — untouched
- `StatCard`, `DispatchItemRow`, `DispatchRecommendationPanel`, `HomeServiceDispatchWorkspace` body — all untouched

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-READINESS-PHASE9F-001)

**Task:** Phase 9F — Add Global CRM Readiness Badge / Indicator

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/crm/readiness/crm-readiness-badge.tsx`
  - Server component — compact single-line pill linking to /crm/setup
  - Props: `{ readiness: ReadinessResult | null }`
  - Visual states: critical (red), warning (amber), ok (green), null/failure (muted)
  - Counts: criticalCount + warningCount from readiness.issues; summary "X critical · Y warnings" or "All clear"
  - Failure state: "Review needed" with neutral muted style
  - Uses `Link` from next/link; `aria-label` for accessibility

- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/layout.tsx` (NEW)
  - Server layout wrapping all /crm/* routes
  - Calls `getLayoutStaffContext()` (React cache()-wrapped — no extra DB call vs dashboard layout)
  - Calls `getCrmReadiness(branchId).catch(() => null)` — failure-safe
  - Renders CrmReadinessBadge above {children}
  - Mobile: badge wrapper uses `px-4 pt-3 md:px-0 md:pt-0` (main is p-0 mobile / p-5 desktop)

**Intentionally Left Unchanged:**
- `src/components/features/crm/today/today-readiness-strip.tsx` — /crm/today page-level strip preserved
- `src/components/shared/readiness-issue-list.tsx` — no changes
- All booking logic, dispatch logic, availability engine, schedule engine unchanged
- No DB schema changed. No public /book behavior changed.

**How branchId is resolved:**
`getLayoutStaffContext()` is already React-`cache()`-wrapped. The `(dashboard)/layout.tsx` calls it
first; `crm/layout.tsx` calls it again — React deduplicates to zero extra DB calls per request.
`branchId = ctx?.me?.branch_id ?? null`.

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-READINESS-PHASE9G-1-001)

**Task:** Phase 9G-1 — Add Daily Operations Missing Readiness Checks

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/queries/crm-readiness.ts`
  - Added `import { createClient } from "@/lib/supabase/server"`
  - Added `getCheckedInNotScheduledIssue(branchId, today, dayOfWeek)`:
    - Queries `staff_shift_checkins` (status='checked_in') then cross-references `staff_schedules` (day_of_week, is_active)
    - Emits `daily:checked-in-not-scheduled` warning when ghost check-ins exist
  - Added `getNoOpeningShiftIssue(branchId, dayOfWeek)`:
    - Queries `staff` (branch_id) then `staff_schedules` (day_of_week, is_active)
    - Suppressed if no staff are scheduled at all (branch likely closed)
    - Emits `daily:no-opening-shift-today` warning when staff are scheduled but none have shift_type='opening'
  - Added `getPendingBookingFollowUpIssue(branchId, today)`:
    - Queries `bookings` where type='online', status='pending', created_at <= now-30min, booking_date >= today
    - Emits `daily:booking-request-no-follow-up` warning for stale pending online bookings
  - Added `getDailyOperationsReadinessIssues(branchId, today, dayOfWeek)`:
    - Coordinator that runs all three checks via `Promise.allSettled` (never rejects)
    - Individual check failures silently suppressed; other checks still surface
  - Modified `getCrmReadinessIssues`:
    - Added `dayOfWeek` computation from `today`
    - Extended `Promise.allSettled` from 2 to 3 sources (now includes `getDailyOperationsReadinessIssues`)
    - Handles `dailyOpsResult` fulfilled/rejected paths with source-failure fallback

**Deferred Checks:**
- None in Phase 9G-1. All three required checks implemented.
- Note: `getNoOpeningShiftIssue` checks individual `staff_schedules` only (not `staff_group_schedule_rules`).
  If a branch uses only group rules to define opening shifts, this check may produce false positives.
  Phase 9G future work can extend this to also check group rules if needed.

**Intentionally Unchanged:**
- No UI changes — existing badge (/crm/layout.tsx), /crm/today strip, /crm/setup list naturally surface new issues
- `src/lib/actions/staff-checkins.ts` — unchanged
- `src/lib/queries/crm-availability.ts` — unchanged
- `src/lib/queries/crm-today.ts` — unchanged
- All booking logic, dispatch logic, availability engine, schedule engine unchanged
- No DB schema changed. No public /book behavior changed.

**Query Strategy:**
- Check 1: 2 Supabase queries (staff_shift_checkins → staff_schedules cross-ref)
- Check 2: 2 Supabase queries (staff → staff_schedules)
- Check 3: 1 Supabase query (bookings with 4 filters + limit 20)
- All queries branch-scoped, date-scoped, column-minimal (select only needed fields)

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-READINESS-PHASE9G-2-001)

**Task:** Phase 9G-2 — Add Dispatch Missing Readiness Checks

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/queries/crm-readiness.ts` — added Phase 9G-2 section with 3 checks + coordinator; integrated as Source 4 in getCrmReadinessIssues

**Checks Added:**
1. `dispatch:assigned-driver-not-checked-in` (critical) — driver assigned to active HS booking but not checked in today. Two-query: bookings with driver_id → staff_shift_checkins cross-ref.
2. `dispatch:home-service-missing-address` (critical) — active HS booking missing metadata.home_service_address.full_address. Single bookings query + TypeScript filter on JSONB.
3. `dispatch:home-service-missing-destination-coordinates` (warning) — active HS booking missing lat/lng coordinates. Same query pattern as Check 2; checks numeric validity via typeof + Number.isNaN.

**Checks Skipped:**
- Check 4 (active home-service no driver) — deliberately excluded. Covered by existing `dispatch:awaiting-driver` issue from mapDispatchStatsToReadinessIssues / getCrmTodaySnapshot. Emitting a second ID for the same condition would confuse operators.

**Helper added:**
- `extractHomeServiceAddress(metadata)` — safe JSONB accessor for home_service_address sub-object
- `getDispatchMissingReadinessIssues(branchId, today)` — Promise.allSettled coordinator; always resolves

**Integration:**
- getCrmReadinessIssues now runs 4 sources in parallel (was 3)
- Source 4 failure emits system:failure:dispatch-missing warning (same pattern as other sources)

**Notes:**
- Home-service detection: `.or("type.eq.home_service,delivery_type.eq.home_service")` (both legacy + new field)
- Active status filter: `.neq("status", "cancelled").neq("status", "completed").neq("status", "no_show")`
- Coordinates stored in metadata JSONB at home_service_address.lat / .lng (numeric)
- Address stored at metadata.home_service_address.full_address (string)
- All queries: branch-scoped, date-scoped (today), column-minimal, limit 50 for booking fetches; entity IDs capped at 20
- No UI changes required — global badge, /crm/today strip, /crm/setup list, /crm/dispatch readiness surface these automatically
- No dispatch actions changed. No booking logic changed. No database schema changed. No public /book behavior changed.

- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 0 warnings)

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (DISPATCH-CENTER-3TAB-001)

**Task:** Build Home-Service Dispatch Center with 3 Tabs

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/dispatch/dispatch-workspace.tsx` — replaced with 3-tab shell; same `HomeServiceDispatchWorkspace` / `HomeServiceDispatchWorkspaceProps` export interface preserved
- `src/components/features/dispatch/dispatch-summary-cards.tsx` (new) — 6 KPI cards: Needs Driver, Ready, En Route, In Service, Completed, Alerts; all values derived from DispatchData
- `src/components/features/dispatch/dispatch-flow-tab.tsx` (new) — Tab 1: booking queue (status badges, missing-info badges, address/staff snippets) + selected booking readiness checklist (therapist/driver/address/GPS/payment) + AssignmentRecommendationPanel for awaiting-driver items
- `src/components/features/dispatch/dispatch-live-map-tab.tsx` (new) — Tab 2: active trips list + honest map placeholder (no fake map; collects live location data counts) + selected trip detail
- `src/components/features/dispatch/dispatch-travel-progress-tab.tsx` (new) — Tab 3: desktop table / mobile cards with progress dot stages (Confirmed → Driver → En Route → Arrived → In Service → Done)
- `src/components/features/dispatch/dispatch-emergency-actions.tsx` (new) — 6 emergency link shortcuts
- `src/components/features/dispatch/dispatch-related-tools.tsx` (new) — 6 related tool links

**Existing components preserved/reused:**
- `dispatch-readiness-utils.ts` — unchanged; `buildAlertIssues` still used in workspace
- `AssignmentRecommendationPanel` — unchanged; reused in Tab 1 for driver assignment
- `assignBookingDriverAction` / `getDriverRecommendationsAction` — unchanged server actions reused
- Both `/crm/dispatch` and `/manager/dispatch` page files — unchanged; same component interface

**Visual improvements:**
- Page title: "Home-Service Dispatch Center" (was "Home Service Dispatch")
- Architecture note visible to operators
- Booking queue: status badges + missing-info + payment badges
- Dispatch readiness checklist per selected booking (therapist, driver, address, GPS, payment)
- Trip timeline visible when travel has started
- Progress stage visualization in Tab 3
- Emergency actions card + related tools card at bottom

**Data: live vs empty state:**
- Summary cards: live (derived from DispatchData.items)
- Dispatch alerts: live (buildAlertIssues from DispatchData.alerts)
- Booking queue: live bookings from getDispatchData
- Selected panel: live RealDispatchItem fields
- Active trips (Tab 2): live dispatchStatus filter
- Location data: live (currentLocation / lat / lng from RealDispatchItem)
- Map rendering: honest placeholder ("Live map will appear when integration is connected")
- Progress stages: derived from live dispatchStatus + timestamps

**Notes:**
- No "Confirm Dispatch" server action was created — Tab 1 shows an honest informational note for ready bookings ("handled by driver via Driver Portal")
- No fake map, no fake route lines, no fake location markers
- Map placeholder shows how many trips have live location snapshots and how many are missing coordinates
- No UI changes to /crm/today dispatch snapshot, /crm/setup readiness list, or /crm/availability
- No booking logic changed. No dispatch actions changed. No DB schema changed. No public /book changed.

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (HYDRATION-FIX-001 — Fix nested <a> in BookingCard)

**Task:** Fix hydration error: `In HTML, <a> cannot be a descendant of <a>` in `crm-booking-queue-panel.tsx`.

**Root Cause:** `BookingCard` wraps its content in `<Link href={...}>` (which renders as `<a>`). Inside the home-service footer row, the "Map ↗" link was also rendered as `<a href={booking.hs_map_url} target="_blank">` — invalid nested anchors per HTML spec.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/crm/today/crm-booking-queue-panel.tsx` — replaced the inner `<a>` map link with `<button type="button">` that calls `window.open(booking.hs_map_url!, "_blank", "noopener,noreferrer")` on click, preserving the same visual style and UX.

**Commit:** `25ac12f`

**Notes:**
- No logic change — "Map ↗" still opens the Google Maps URL in a new tab
- `e.preventDefault()` + `e.stopPropagation()` prevent the outer Link click from firing
- No other components affected

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-SERVICES-ASSIGNMENTS-001 — Therapist Assignments Tab)

**Task:** Add Therapist Assignments tab to /crm/services.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/services/page.tsx` — replaced stacked Section layout with `CrmServicesWorkspace`; reads `?tab=assignments` searchParam to pre-select tab server-side
- `src/components/features/crm/services/crm-services-workspace.tsx` (NEW) — client tab shell managing "Active Services" | "Therapist Assignments" tab state; initialised from `initialTab` prop (no useEffect needed)
- `src/components/features/crm/services/crm-therapist-assignment-tab.tsx` (NEW) — full Therapist Assignments tab: intro card, stat cards (active services + services without therapist), filter row (search / category / service type / missing-only toggle), desktop assignment table, right-side help panel
- `src/components/features/crm/services/service-assignment-table-row.tsx` (NEW) — individual table row with expand/collapse; inline assign (select + button) + remove (chip ✕) controls, reuses existing server actions
- `src/components/features/crm/services/types.ts` — added `ServiceTableRow` (extends `ServiceRow` with `duration` and `price`)
- `src/components/features/crm/services/crm-service-therapist-panel.tsx` — updated readiness `actionHref` to `/crm/services?tab=assignments`
- `src/components/features/crm/services/provider-assignment-card.tsx` — updated readiness `actionHref` to `/crm/services?tab=assignments`

**Notes:**
- Active Services tab keeps existing ServicesOfferedTab (service toggle, visibility, price overrides) completely unchanged
- All assignment mutations use existing `assignProviderToServiceAction` and `removeProviderFromServiceAction` — no new server actions
- Last-provider protection for public active services remains enforced server-side
- Drivers, utility staff, CRM/front-desk, inactive staff excluded by `isValidProvider()` logic (same as before)
- `buildServiceTableRows()` is a client-side pure function (mirrors server-side `buildServiceRows` in panel)
- Tab switching from readiness links uses `?tab=assignments` query param (server-side, no useEffect lint issue)
- `id="therapist-assignments"` is on the tab content container for direct scroll anchoring when the tab is active
- No booking logic changed. No dispatch actions changed. No DB schema changed. No public /book changed.

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-SERVICES-COMPACT-001 — Compact Provider Table Rows)

**Task:** Fix scalability of Therapist Assignments table — rows with many providers expanded vertically.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/crm/services/service-assignment-table-row.tsx` (rewritten) — now shows max 3 mini provider chips inline + "+N more" badge + "N assigned" count; Manage/Assign Therapist button opens Sheet (no inline expand)
- `src/components/features/crm/services/provider-assignment-sheet.tsx` (NEW) — right-side Sheet (480px) with service summary bar, full vertical provider list with Remove buttons, Add Provider select + Assign button, status feedback, eligibility note

**Notes:**
- Sheet uses existing `Sheet`/`SheetContent`/`SheetHeader`/`SheetTitle` from `@/components/ui/sheet` (backed by `@base-ui/react/dialog`)
- All mutations reuse `assignProviderToServiceAction` and `removeProviderFromServiceAction` unchanged
- Last-provider protection for public active services still enforced server-side
- Sheet resets `status` and `selectedStaffId` on close
- `router.refresh()` after mutations keeps data fresh without full page reload

**Build Status:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ PASS
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ PASS
- `pnpm build`: ✅ PASS (85 routes)

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (CRM-SERVICES-TABLE-REDESIGN-001 — Professional SaaS Table Redesign)

**Task:** Redesign Therapist Assignments tab into a compact professional SaaS table.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/crm/services/crm-therapist-assignment-tab.tsx` (rewritten)
  - 4 KPI `StatCard` components: Active Services, Without Therapist, Eligible Providers, Fully Assigned
  - `RightRail` with "Who can be assigned?" card, "Assignment Overview" card (color-coded dots + counts), and Tip card
  - CSS grid layout: `grid-cols-[minmax(0,1fr)_280px]` (fluid main table + 280px right rail)
  - Table header updated to 5 columns: Service | Category | Assigned Therapists | Status | Actions
  - Client-side pagination: 10/25/50 rows per page; ellipsis page numbers via `getPageNumbers()`
  - `safeCurrentPage = Math.min(currentPage, totalPages)` — clamps page on filter change without useEffect
  - Filter row event handlers explicitly call `setCurrentPage(1)` (in event handlers, not effects)
- `src/components/features/crm/services/service-assignment-table-row.tsx` (updated)
  - Added `getAssignmentStatus(row)` helper: Well Assigned (≥2 providers, green), Low Coverage (1 provider, amber), Needs Assignment (0 providers, red)
  - Added STATUS `<td>` between Assigned Therapists and Actions columns
  - STATUS cell renders pill badge (color-coded) + caption text below

**Commit:** 481aac8

**Notes:**
- Table now has 5 columns matching header: Service | Category | Assigned Therapists | Status | Actions
- All mutations, last-provider protection, and Sheet drawer behavior unchanged
- No booking logic changed. No DB schema changed.

**Build Status:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ PASS
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ PASS

### 2026-05-25 — Claude Code (WORKSPACE-PREFETCH-001)

**Task:** Implement workspace route warm-up and smart prefetching for CradleHub CRM/Manager/Owner workspaces.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/workspace/workspace-route-prefetcher.tsx` — reusable client component with connection-aware prefetching (Data Saver, 2g guards, requestIdleCallback fallback)
- `src/components/features/workspace/workspace-prefetch-config.ts` — workspace route configs with immediate / idle / hover priority tiers
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/layout.tsx` — manager layout wrapper mounting the prefetcher
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/layout.tsx` — owner layout wrapper mounting the prefetcher
- `src/lib/queries/workspace-cached.ts` — `unstable_cache` wrappers for high-traffic queries (today snapshot, availability, dispatch, setup health)

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/layout.tsx` — added `<WorkspaceRoutePrefetcher config={CRM_PREFETCH} />`
- `src/components/features/dashboard/sidebar.tsx` — NavLink now calls `router.prefetch` on `onMouseEnter` for instant hover warming
- `src/lib/cache/cache-tags.ts` — added workspace-scoped cache tags (`crm-workspace`, `crm-bookings`, `crm-dispatch`, `crm-availability`, `crm-setup`, `manager-workspace`, `owner-workspace`) plus batch invalidation helpers (`invalidateCrmWorkspace`, `invalidateManagerWorkspace`, `invalidateOwnerWorkspace`)
- `src/lib/actions/staff-checkins.ts` — added `invalidateCrmWorkspace` + `invalidateManagerWorkspace` after check-in/check-out
- `src/lib/actions/driver-actions.ts` — added `invalidateCrmWorkspace` after driver assignment
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/bookings/actions.ts` — added `invalidateTag(cacheTags.crmWorkspace(...))` after payment confirmation
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/bookings/actions.ts` — added workspace tag invalidation after status edit, booking edit, and payment update
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/bookings/actions.ts` — added owner + CRM workspace tag invalidation after status/payment updates (fetches booking branch_id for cross-branch owner actions)
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/actions.ts` — added CRM workspace tag invalidation after customer create/update
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/staff/actions.ts` — added workspace tag invalidation after schedule/blocked-time/override mutations
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/staff-availability/actions.ts` — added CRM workspace tag invalidation after manual schedule import
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/services/actions.ts` — added CRM workspace tag invalidation after provider assign/remove

**Design Decisions:**
- Immediate routes (today, control, bookings, dispatch) prefetch ~250ms after mount.
- Idle routes (availability, staff-availability, customers, setup) defer via `requestIdleCallback` or 2s fallback.
- Heavy routes (reports, live map, reconciliation, analytics) are NEVER auto-prefetched — they warm only on sidebar hover.
- Slow connections (<0.5 downlink, 2g, Data Saver) skip idle prefetch entirely.
- Cached queries use 1-hour `revalidate` with tag-based invalidation on mutations, keeping data fresh without extra DB round-trips.

**Safety:**
- No booking logic changed.
- No DB schema changed.
- No routes removed.
- RBAC preserved — prefetcher is a pure client component with no data access.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 1 pre-existing warning)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing (99 routes)

### 2026-05-26 — Claude Code (FRONTDESK-UI-REDESIGN-001 — Front Desk Pages UI Redesign)

**Task:** Redesign and simplify the overloaded Front Desk operational pages so main content appears above the fold, readiness warnings are accessible but not dominant, and each page reads like a focused professional tool.

**Pages Fixed:**
1. `/crm/today` — Daily Operations Center
2. `/crm/setup` — Rules & Setup Center
3. `/crm/availability` — Live Availability & Check-In Center

**DO NOT TOUCH — Preserved Unchanged:**
- `/crm/staff-availability` — Schedule Setup Center (no changes)

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/shared/system-readiness-bar.tsx` — Compact single-line horizontal bar showing total issue count, category breakdown (Critical: N · Warning: N), and a "Review issues →" button that opens a Sheet panel. Panel groups all issues by scope (Daily Ops, Schedule, Dispatch, Payment, Services, Spaces, Setup, System). Fully keyboard-accessible; closes on ESC. Client component — receives plain serializable `ReadinessIssue[]` props from server components.
- `src/components/shared/page-help-disclosure.tsx` — Collapsible "How this page works" section. Defaults closed so it doesn't push main content down. Uses `aria-expanded` / `aria-controls` / `role="region"` for accessibility. Trigger shows ℹ️ icon + label + animated chevron.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/today/page.tsx`
  - Removed `TodayReadinessStrip` (showed up to 3 full ReadinessIssueCards inline)
  - Added `SystemReadinessBar` above the page header — single compact line
  - Moved `TodayQuickActions` immediately after `PageHeader` (primary actions above the fold)
  - Removed `TodayWorkflowStrip` (static step guide rarely needed after first day)
  - Removed `TodayAttentionStrip` (notification strip replaced by readiness bar)
  - Removed `TodaySystemMatchStatus` (orientation card; info now accessible via the review panel)
  - Kept all data queries, server actions, booking queue, KPI strip, right rail, emergency actions unchanged

- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/setup/page.tsx`
  - Removed verbose warning banner (the large colored alert block)
  - Removed inline `ReadinessIssueList` (full list of issues was shown openly)
  - Added `SystemReadinessBar` above the page header
  - Kept `CrmBookingFlowRules`, `CrmSetupHealthCards`, `CrmSetupWorkspaceTiles`, `CrmBookingImpactMatrix`
  - Readiness fallback: when `getCrmReadiness` fails, bar shows empty (All Clear) — health cards below still render

- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/availability/page.tsx`
  - Moved `CheckInExplainer` (3-card explainer section) inside `PageHelpDisclosure` — collapsed by default
  - Removed inline `ReadinessIssueList` between summary and board
  - Added `SystemReadinessBar` above page header — derives issues from `buildAvailabilityReadinessIssues`
  - Moved `CrmAvailabilityClient` (the 4-tab board) up — immediately after KPI summary
  - Moved `StartDayChecklist` into a second `PageHelpDisclosure` — collapsed by default
  - Kept `LiveAvailabilityImpactCard` and `AvailabilityRelatedTools` as informational footer

**Design Decisions:**
- `SystemReadinessBar` is a single slim bar (36px tall) — never pushes content down.
- Full issue details are always accessible via "Review issues →" Sheet panel.
- `PageHelpDisclosure` uses native `hidden` attribute (no animation flicker, SSR-safe).
- All existing data queries, server actions, permissions, booking logic, and Schedule Setup page are unchanged.
- No new npm packages installed.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 1 pre-existing warning in staff-availability/actions.ts)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing (85/85 routes)

### 2026-05-26 — Kimi (CRM-SCHEDULE-REDESIGN-001 — Fixed-Height Daily Timeline Board)

**Task:** Redesign CRM Schedule page into a fixed-height daily timeline board with density controls, collapsible staff groups, and inline details panel.

**Problem:** The schedule grid expanded vertically with every staff member. With 30+ staff, the page became an extremely long scroll page.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-density.tsx` — Density context + toggle UI
- `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-staff-group.tsx` — Collapsible staff group headers
- `src/components/features/schedule/crm-schedule-details-panel.tsx` — Inline right-side details panel

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/schedule/page.tsx` — Added PageHeader, SystemReadinessBar, wrapper
- `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-workspace.tsx` — CRM uses inline panel + density provider
- `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-board-panel.tsx` — Added `showHeader` prop
- `src/components/features/schedule/daily-schedule-board.tsx` — Fixed-height scroll container + staff groups
- `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-time-header.tsx` — Density-aware height
- `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-staff-cell.tsx` — Density-aware sizing
- `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-staff-row.tsx` — Density-aware row height
- `src/lib/utils/schedule-timeline.ts` — Added `getRowHeightPx()` and `getHeaderHeightPx()`

**Behavior:**
- Fixed-height board (`maxHeight: calc(100vh - 380px)`) with internal scroll
- Sticky staff column + time header preserved
- Density: Comfortable (76px), Compact (56px, default), Ultra-compact (42px)
- Groups: In Progress (expanded), Scheduled Today (expanded), Off Today (collapsed)
- Owner/manager schedule pages completely untouched

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing (85/85 routes)

### 2026-05-26 — Claude (FRONTDESK-UI-REDESIGN-001 Phase 2 — Availability Board Deep Redesign)

**Task:** The Live Availability board was still too sparse and wide after Phase 1 — still Kanban-style with tall cards. Deep redesign into a 4-column dense operations board/table hybrid matching the approved mockup direction.

**Files Rewritten (3):**

`src/components/features/crm/availability/crm-availability-board.tsx`:
- Complete rewrite from 5-column Kanban (tall cards, static layout) → 4-column fixed-height compact board
- `BOARD_HEIGHT = 380px`; each column has `overflow-y: auto` for scroll within the fixed height
- Columns: Not Checked In (amber, `#c97a18`) | Available Now (green, `#2d9e63`) | Busy/Assigned (blue, `#2471a3`) | Needs Attention (orange, `#c97a18`)
- `CompactStaffRow`: `minHeight: 72px`, flex row — 32px Avatar with initials + colored bg + name/role/time/booking-service div + StatusChip + CheckinAction
- `Avatar`: 32px circle, name initials, bg color driven by `AVATAR_BG: Record<LiveStatus, string>`
- `STATUS_META: Record<LiveStatus, {...}>` for status badge colors
- `NeedsAttentionContent`: groups staff into "No Schedule Set" and "Needs Review" via `buildGroups()`; shows group header with count badge + up to 4 rows + "+N more" overflow
- Off Today / Checked Out removed as separate columns — accessible via Staff List tab
- `maxPerColumn` prop kept for backward compat (unused)

`src/components/features/crm/availability/crm-availability-summary.tsx`:
- Complete rewrite — replaced tall `StatCard` (1.75rem value font-size) with compact `MetricChip` inline components
- `MetricChip`: `inline-flex`, `padding: 5px 11px`, `border-radius: 8px`, 7px colored dot + 10px uppercase label + 14px bold value
- `highlight` prop: colored border + faint bg when actionable (checkedIn > 0, availableNow > 0, notCheckedIn > 0, etc.)
- Chips: Scheduled N/N | Checked In | Available | Busy | Not In | Drivers N/N | Attention (conditional, only when > 0)
- Layout: `flexWrap: "wrap"`, `gap: "0.5rem"` — chips flow naturally, no grid

`src/components/features/crm/availability/crm-availability-client.tsx`:
- Added quick action buttons right of the tab bar: ⚠ Schedule Issues (amber, shows when issueCount > 0 and not already on that tab), 🚗 Drivers (shows when driverCount > 0 and not on driver tab), Staff List (shows when not on staff_list tab), ↺ Refresh (always, useTransition + router.refresh())
- Quick action button style: 11px/500, surface bg, soft border, radius 6
- Tab bar tightened: font-size 12, font-weight 600 when active; Schedule Issues badge uses `#c97a18`
- All four tab panels (live_board, staff_list, schedule_issues, driver_readiness) preserved exactly in behavior
- StaffListView, ScheduleIssuesView, DriverReadinessView: no functional changes

**What was NOT changed:** getCrmAvailabilitySnapshot query, check-in/check-out server actions, RBAC, schedule logic, dispatch logic, all other pages, availability calculations.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 1 pre-existing warning in staff-availability/actions.ts)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing (85/85 routes)

### 2026-05-26 — Kimi (CRM-SIDEBAR-NAV-FIX-001 — Fix CRM Sidebar Navigation)

**Task:** Fix CRM sidebar navigation grouping and workspace badge sublabel bug.

**Problem 1:** Workspace badge showed user's role access level instead of workspace description.
- Example: Owner viewing `/crm/today` saw "FRONT DESK WORKSPACE · Owner access" instead of "Front-desk access".
- This was misleading for users and made it unclear which workspace they were actually in.

**Problem 2:** CRM nav groups were not optimally organized.
- "Availability" and "Schedule Setup" were in separate groups, making daily readiness tools hard to find.
- "Schedule Setup" was under "Staff & Internal Work" instead of near other daily operations tools.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/dashboard/sidebar.tsx`
  - Removed `roleMeta.sublabel` override in workspace badge `meta` object
  - Badge now uses `pathMeta` directly so sublabel describes the current workspace
  - All roles viewing any workspace now see the correct workspace description

- `src/components/features/dashboard/nav-config.ts`
  - Reorganized CRM_NAV_GROUPS from 5 groups → 6 groups
  - New "Daily Readiness" group: Staff Availability (`/crm/availability`), Schedule Setup (`/crm/staff-availability`)
  - "Main Operations" reordered: Today, Control Center, Bookings, Dispatch, Live Map, Schedule
  - "Control" renamed to "Control Center"
  - "Availability" renamed to "Staff Availability"
  - CSR_HEAD_NAV_GROUPS and CSR_STAFF_NAV_GROUPS now use defensive spread `[...CRM_NAV_GROUPS]`

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing (85/85 routes)
- Note: 3 pre-existing lint errors in committed code (unrelated to this change)

### 2026-05-26 — Kimi (CRM-SERVICES-MODAL-PILOT-001 — Centered Provider Assignment Modal)

**Task:** Pilot the centered task modal pattern on the CRM Services provider assignment UI.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/crm/services/provider-assignment-sheet.tsx` (rewritten)
  - Converted from side Sheet to centered Dialog (`sm:max-w-3xl`, `max-h-[85vh]`)
  - Added fixed footer with "Done" button and assigned provider count summary
  - Added `min-h-0` to scrollable body for proper flex overflow handling
  - Replaced native `<select>` dropdown with searchable provider list:
    - Search input filters eligible providers by name
    - Each provider shown as a compact row (avatar, name, staff type badge, "Add" button)
    - Immediate assign on click (calls existing `assignProviderToServiceAction`)
    - Empty state for no search matches
  - Assigned providers section unchanged (avatar, name, type badge, "Remove" button)
  - Service summary bar preserved (name, category, duration, price, delivery type, visibility)
  - Status messages and eligibility note preserved
  - All server actions unchanged (`assignProviderToServiceAction`, `removeProviderFromServiceAction`)

**Design Decisions:**
- Footer stays visible while body scrolls — `shrink-0` header/summary/footer + `flex-1 min-h-0 overflow-y-auto` body
- One-provider-at-a-time assignment preserved (no batch action needed)
- Search state resets on modal close
- Mobile: full-screen `max-sm:h-[100dvh]` with same scrollable body + sticky footer

**Scope:**
- CRM Services page only — Manager and Owner services pages untouched
- No booking logic changed. No DB schema changed. No RBAC changed.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 1 pre-existing warning in staff-availability/actions.ts)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing (85/85 routes)

### 2026-05-28 — Claude (SERVICE-MGMT-BUGFIX-001 — Service management bug fixes)

**Task:** Fix three service-management bugs identified via static code inspection of src.zip.

**Files Changed:**

`src/components/features/staff/staff-service-editor-sheet.tsx` (updated):
- `DialogContent` height: `max-h-[85vh]` → `h-[90dvh] max-h-[90dvh]`; added `max-sm:max-h-[100dvh]`
- Scrollable body: added `min-h-0` and `overscroll-contain`; added `pb-24` bottom padding
- Fixes: service list items below the viewport were unreachable on desktop

`src/app/(dashboard)/crm/services/actions.ts` (updated):
- `CRM_SETUP_ROLES`: added `"csr_staff"` and `"csr"` so CSR staff who can open the page can also call assign/remove actions
- Updated file-level MVP comment to name the full role set
- Added `revalidatePath("/manager/services")` to both `assignProviderToServiceAction` and `removeProviderFromServiceAction`

`src/app/(dashboard)/owner/branches/actions.ts` (updated):
- `requireOwnerOrBranchManager`: added `isSuperAdmin(user.id)` check before staff lookup
- Added `"csr_staff"` and `"csr"` to branch-scoped roles
- `updateBranchServiceEligibilityAction`: chained `.select("id, available_in_spa, available_home_service").maybeSingle()` — now returns `success: false` when no row is updated

`src/components/features/manager-settings/services-offered-tab.tsx` (updated):
- Added `localServices` state + `useEffect` to sync from `services` prop
- `activeServices` derived from `localServices` so optimistic updates render immediately
- `handleEligibilityChange` updates `localServices` on success before `router.refresh()`

**Intentionally Unchanged:** Booking logic, scheduling, public booking flow, DB schema.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing (all routes)

### 2026-05-28 — Claude (MVP-ROUTING-001 — Soft-pause Owner/Manager Workspaces, CRM as Main Command Center)

**Task:** Route all admin/management roles to /crm for MVP. Soft-pause /owner and /manager routes. Create typed CRM permission helpers. Hide Owner/Manager from workspace nav.

**Files Changed:**

`src/proxy.ts` (updated):
- `resolveWorkspace()`: owner, manager, assistant_manager, store_manager now resolve to `/crm` instead of `/owner`/`/manager`
- Access guard: owner/manager/assistant_manager/store_manager redirected to `/crm` if not on a `/crm` path (they no longer have cross-workspace bypass)

`src/lib/permissions.ts` (updated):
- `getDefaultDashboardPath()`: owner and management roles now return `/crm`; staff/therapist/masseuse/service_provider variants explicitly return `/staff-portal`

`src/app/(auth)/login/actions.ts` (updated):
- Dev bypass redirect changed from `/owner` to `/crm`

`src/app/(dashboard)/owner/layout.tsx` (updated):
- Replaced prefetch layout with a single `redirect("/crm")` — all /owner/* routes silently redirect to /crm. Files preserved.

`src/app/(dashboard)/manager/layout.tsx` (updated):
- Replaced prefetch layout with a single `redirect("/crm")` — all /manager/* routes silently redirect to /crm. Files preserved.

`src/lib/auth/crm-permissions.ts` (created):
- `CRM_WORKSPACE_ROLES` const and `CrmWorkspaceRole` type
- `canAccessCrmWorkspace`, `canManageCrmSetup`, `canManageServices`, `canManageBookings`, `canConfirmPayments`, `canManageCustomers`, `canManageStaffAssignments`, `canManageResources`, `canManageDispatch` — all typed helpers with MVP-correct access levels

`src/components/features/dashboard/nav-config.ts` (updated):
- `WorkspaceNav` type: added `mvpHidden?: boolean` flag
- Owner and Manager workspace entries marked `mvpHidden: true`
- `resolveWorkspaceKeyFromRole()`: owner/manager/assistant_manager/store_manager now resolve to `"crm"` (CRM nav and badge)

`src/components/features/dashboard/sidebar.tsx` (updated):
- Minor comment on `isManagerRoute` to note /manager now redirects (no logic change needed — role→workspace resolution already updated in nav-config)

**Behavior:**
- owner, manager, assistant_manager, store_manager → /crm on login and on any direct URL attempt
- /owner/* and /manager/* all silently redirect to /crm via layout.tsx
- Sidebar shows CRM nav and workspace badge for management roles
- Owner/Manager workspace nav entries exist but are `mvpHidden: true` (rendering layer can filter)
- CRM permission helpers available for new feature gates

**Intentionally NOT changed:**
- /owner/* and /manager/* page components (preserved for future restoration)
- Public booking flow
- Staff portal, driver portal
- Supabase schema, RLS, database queries

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 new errors; 4 pre-existing errors in services-offered-tab.tsx, staff-schedule-card.tsx, service-image.tsx not introduced by this task)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing (87/87 routes)

### 2026-05-28 — Kimi (Schedule Setup + Staff Schedule Tab Enhancement)

**Task:** Enhance CRM Schedule Setup and Staff Schedule tabs while preserving existing schedule editing workflows.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/daily-timeline-right-rail.tsx` — contextual right rail for Daily Timeline tab
- `src/app/api/crm/availability/route.ts` — API route for live availability data
- `src/app/api/crm/staff-schedule/overview/route.ts` — API route for staff schedule overview data

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/schedule/page.tsx` — Updated to use `ScheduleWorkspaceShell`
- `src/components/features/schedule/workspace/schedule-workspace-shell.tsx` — Unified shell with header, tabs, status chips, metric grid
- `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/schedule-setup-tab.tsx` — Now renders actual `ScheduleSetupWorkspace` via SWR
- `src/components/features/schedule/tabs/staff-schedule-tab.tsx` — Now renders actual `StaffSchedulePageClient` via SWR
- `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-workspace.tsx` — Added `showToolbar`, `showKpiCards`, `rightRailExtras` props (backward-compatible)
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/schedule-group-cards.tsx` — Enhanced active state styling (forest green), improved spacing
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/schedule-setup-right-rail.tsx` — Enhanced card styling with icon circles, consistent typography
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/schedule-setup-workspace.tsx` — Enhanced container grid, clickable setup flow breadcrumb
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/staff-schedule-page-client.tsx` — Stat strip now uses responsive grid

**Behavior:**
- `/crm/schedule?tab=setup` renders the full `ScheduleSetupWorkspace` (group tabs, weekly rules editor, right rail)
- `/crm/schedule?tab=staff` renders the full `StaffSchedulePageClient` (stat strip, toolbar, staff list, detail sheet)
- `/crm/staff-availability` continues to render `ScheduleSetupWorkspace` directly (unchanged page structure)
- Both tabs fetch data via SWR from new API routes
- Old routes `/crm/availability` and `/crm/staff-availability` preserved

**Build Status:** ✅ Passing | **Type-check:** ✅ Passing | **Lint:** ✅ Passing (0 errors, 0 warnings)

### 2026-05-28 — Kimi (READINESS-HEADER-001 — Replace Full-Width System Readiness Banner With Compact Header Indicator)

**Task:** Remove the persistent full-width System Readiness warning banner from workspace page content and replace it with a compact, premium readiness indicator in the shared header/topbar.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/dashboard/workspace-readiness-indicator.tsx` — compact rounded-full chip with icon, status text, issue count; opens a popover with full issue list, scope icons, problem descriptions, and action links; supports ok/warning/critical/unavailable states; keyboard accessible (Escape closes)

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/dashboard/header.tsx` — added optional `readiness?: ReadinessResult | null` prop; renders `WorkspaceReadinessIndicator` between date and notification bell
- `src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` — fetches `getCrmReadiness(branchId)` failure-safely and passes to `Header`; readiness query now runs once per dashboard layout render instead of per CRM page
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/layout.tsx` — removed `CrmReadinessBadgeWrapper` and old readiness banner from CRM content flow; layout now only renders route prefetcher
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/setup/page.tsx` — removed `SystemReadinessBar` import and render; removed now-unused `getCrmReadiness` call and readiness-derived variables; setup page content starts immediately after tab nav
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/availability/page.tsx` — removed `SystemReadinessBar` import and render; removed `buildAvailabilityReadinessIssues` and `buildReadinessResult` imports; removed availability-specific readiness variables; page content starts immediately after tab nav

**Behavior:**
- All CRM pages (`/crm/today`, `/crm/schedule`, `/crm/setup`, `/crm/availability`, `/crm/bookings`, `/crm/dispatch`, `/crm/services`, `/crm/spaces-rules`, `/crm/customers`, `/crm/staff-applications`, `/crm/staff-availability`) no longer have a full-width readiness banner pushing content down.
- A compact 32px-tall rounded-full chip appears in the shared header next to the notification bell.
- Chip states:
  - `System Ready` (green, ✅) when no issues
  - `System: N issues` (amber, ⚠️) when warnings exist
  - `Critical: N issues` (red, ⛔) when critical issues exist
  - `Unavailable` (muted, ⚠️) when readiness query fails
- Clicking the chip opens a popover listing every readiness issue with scope icon, title, problem description, count badge, and direct action link.
- Popover footer has an "Open Setup Center ›" link to `/crm/setup`.
- Accessibility: native `<button>` trigger, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, `aria-label`, keyboard focusable, Escape closes popover.
- Readiness detection logic (`getCrmReadiness`, `getCrmReadinessIssues`, all mappers) is completely unchanged.
- Business logic, RBAC, and auth are unchanged.

**Intentionally NOT changed:**
- `src/components/shared/system-readiness-bar.tsx` — component preserved (may be referenced by other unused components)
- `src/components/features/crm/readiness/crm-readiness-badge.tsx` — preserved but no longer imported
- `src/components/features/crm/readiness/crm-readiness-badge-wrapper.tsx` — preserved but no longer imported
- `src/components/features/schedule/crm-schedule-view.tsx` — still imports `SystemReadinessBar` but component is unused
- `src/components/features/crm/today/today-readiness-strip.tsx` — page-specific inline readiness strip on `/crm/today` is preserved (allowed by design rules)

### 2026-05-29 — Claude (CRM-HOME-SVC-FIX-001 — Fix Home-Service Services Not Showing in Public Booking Wizard)

**Task:** Fix the bug where CRM enabling a service for Home Service did not result in it appearing in the public booking wizard.

**Root causes:**
1. `updateBranchServiceEligibilityAction` used `.select().maybeSingle()` and returned failure when 0 rows matched or data was null — causing UI to silently revert the toggle while the DB may not have been updated.
2. The action only revalidated CRM/owner/manager paths, not the public booking routes (`/`, `/services`, `/book`).
3. The `/api/public/booking-context` route had no `Cache-Control: no-store` header — browser could cache stale service data.
4. The Home Service toggle had no warning when the service was inactive or CSR-only, causing confusing "nothing shows up" after toggling.
5. Readiness checklist items had no guidance notes on how to fix failures.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/branches/actions.ts`
  - `updateBranchServiceEligibilityAction`: replaced `.select().maybeSingle()` with a plain update + separate existence check; added `/`, `/services`, `/book` revalidation
  - `updateBranchServiceDeliveryModeAction`: added `/`, `/services`, `/book` revalidation
- `src/app/api/public/booking-context/route.ts` — added `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` and `Cache-Control: no-store, must-revalidate` response header
- `src/components/features/crm/services/selected-service-editor-rail.tsx` — `HomeServiceToggleSection` now shows contextual warnings when service is inactive or not public; readiness checklist items show guidance notes
- `src/components/features/crm/services/service-customization-table.tsx` — `HomeServiceToggle` shows ⚠ indicator and tooltip when service is ON but won't appear publicly

### 2026-05-28 — Kimi (CRM-STAFF-UI-002 — Optimize Staff Popups, Drawers, and Service Capability Modals)

**Task:** Optimize all staff-related overlays in the CRM workspace: Edit Staff Profile drawer, Edit Service Capabilities modal, and staff service assignment popups.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/staff/staff-edit-form.tsx` — Added `onEditServices`, `formId`, `compact`, `onDirtyChange`, `onSuccess` props. Service checkbox grid is now hidden when `onEditServices` is provided; instead shows a compact summary (count + top 5 chips + "Edit Services" button). Inline Save button hidden in compact mode. Form gets `id` attribute for external footer submit.
- `src/components/features/crm/staff/crm-staff-management-tab.tsx` — Sheet restructured with fixed header, scrollable body (`flex-1 overflow-y-auto`), sticky footer with Cancel/Save buttons. Width narrowed to `sm:max-w-lg`. Added unsaved changes `AlertDialog` for the staff edit sheet. Passes `onEditServices` to open the service editor from the drawer. Tracks `editSheetDirty` state via `onDirtyChange`/`onSuccess`.
- `src/components/features/staff/staff-service-editor-sheet.tsx` — Service chips replaced with checkbox grid (1-col mobile, 2-col desktop). Each checkbox item shows service name + duration. Added `staffName` prop shown in header. Footer button text changed from "Done — N services selected" to "Save N services". Added unsaved changes `AlertDialog` when closing with modified selections. Added `onOpenChange` handler that captures baseline selections on open and checks for changes on close.
- `src/components/features/crm/staff/crm-staff-assignments-tab.tsx` — Passes `staffName` prop to `StaffServiceEditorSheet`.

**Behavior:**
- Staff Profile drawer is now narrow (max-w-lg), scrollable, with sticky footer. It no longer contains the full service checklist.
- Service capability editing opens in the dedicated wider modal with category accordions, search, and Selected tab.
- Closing either overlay with unsaved changes shows a confirmation dialog.
- Owner page (`owner/staff/[staffId]`) is unaffected — still shows full service checkboxes inline.

### 2026-05-28 — Kimi (CRM-MODAL-SYS-001 — Build Central CRM Modal System and Refactor CRM Page Popups)

**Task:** Create a central reusable CRM overlay system (AdminDialog, AdminDrawer, header/body/footer subcomponents) and refactor priority CRM page popups to use it.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/shared/overlays/admin-dialog.tsx` — Central dialog shell wrapping `@base-ui/react/dialog` primitives. Size variants: sm/md/lg/xl/wide/full. Backdrop: `bg-black/35`. Max-height: `min(90vh, calc(100dvh - 48px))`. Flex column with `overflow-hidden`.
- `src/components/shared/overlays/admin-drawer.tsx` — Central drawer shell wrapping `@base-ui/react/dialog` primitives. Size variants: sm/md/lg. Right-side drawer, `h-[100dvh]`, flex column.
- `src/components/shared/overlays/admin-overlay-header.tsx` — Fixed/sticky header with title + description + optional children slot.
- `src/components/shared/overlays/admin-overlay-toolbar.tsx` — Optional shrink-0 toolbar with border-bottom.
- `src/components/shared/overlays/admin-overlay-body.tsx` — Scrollable body with `min-h-0 flex-1 overflow-y-auto` and optional padding.
- `src/components/shared/overlays/admin-overlay-footer.tsx` — Sticky footer with border-top + backdrop blur.
- `src/components/shared/overlays/confirm-unsaved-changes-dialog.tsx` — Reusable AlertDialog wrapper for "Discard changes?" confirmation.
- `src/components/shared/overlays/index.ts` — Barrel export for all overlay components.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/staff/staff-service-editor-sheet.tsx` — Replaced `Dialog`/`DialogContent`/`DialogHeader`/`DialogFooter` with `AdminDialog` + `AdminOverlayHeader`/`AdminOverlayToolbar`/`AdminOverlayBody`/`AdminOverlayFooter`. Size: `xl`. Replaced inline `AlertDialog` with `ConfirmUnsavedChangesDialog`.
- `src/components/features/crm/services/provider-assignment-sheet.tsx` — Replaced `Dialog`/`DialogContent`/`DialogHeader`/`DialogTitle`/`DialogDescription`/`DialogFooter` with `AdminDialog` + overlay subcomponents. Size: `lg`.
- `src/components/features/crm/staff/crm-staff-management-tab.tsx` — Replaced `Sheet`/`SheetContent`/`SheetHeader`/`SheetTitle`/`SheetDescription`/`SheetFooter` with `AdminDrawer` + overlay subcomponents. Size: `md`. Replaced inline `AlertDialog` with `ConfirmUnsavedChangesDialog`.

**Overlay Inventory (CRM page-level):**
- ✅ Refactored: Edit Staff Profile drawer, Edit Service Capabilities modal, Provider Assignment modal
- ⏭️ Not touched (excluded per task): notification bell popovers, readiness chip popovers, readiness horizontal bars, sidebar/mobile nav drawers, toast overlays, hover cards, dropdown menus, command/search popovers
- ⏭️ Not CRM: Booking details sheet (schedule workspace, hidden in CRM context), staff approval workspace (owner context)

### 2026-05-28 — Kimi (CRM-MODAL-002 — Fix Service Capability Modal Scrolling)

**Task:** Fix the Edit Service Capabilities modal so all services are reachable by internal scroll, the footer never covers content, and the page behind the modal does not scroll.

**Root Cause:**
1. `AdminDialog` was vertically centered with `top-1/2 left-1/2 translate-x/y-1/2`. For tall content, centering caused the popup to push against viewport edges and the inner flex body's `overflow-y-auto` scrollbar to be clipped or ineffective.
2. `staff-service-editor-sheet.tsx` used a stacked accordion layout where every category rendered into the same scroll column. When one category with 50+ services expanded, the scrollable body became taller than the allocated flex space, but the scrollbar was not reliably usable because the flex parent height was not definite.
3. The body had `pb-24` padding-bottom hack attempting to clear a footer that was already `shrink-0` in the flex column, meaning the padding was unnecessary and browser handling of bottom padding in overflow containers is inconsistent.
4. Dozens of inline `style={{...}}` props throughout the file made layout debugging fragile and violated project style rules.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/shared/overlays/admin-dialog.tsx` — Changed positioning from `top-1/2 left-1/2 translate-x/y-1/2` to `top-6 left-1/2 translate-x-1/2`. Added explicit `h-auto max-h-[calc(100dvh-3rem)]` so the flex column has a definite, viewport-safe height. Close button remains absolute.
- `src/components/features/staff/staff-service-editor-sheet.tsx` — Complete rewrite of internal layout:
  - Replaced stacked accordion with split-pane layout: fixed 220px category rail on the left, scrollable service list panel on the right.
  - `AdminOverlayBody` now uses `overflow-hidden p-0 flex flex-col`. Inside it, a responsive flex/grid wrapper (`flex flex-1 min-h-0 flex-col sm:grid sm:grid-cols-[220px_1fr]`) creates the split.
  - Category rail: `shrink-0 sm:min-h-0 overflow-x-auto sm:overflow-y-auto` with selection badges.
  - Service list panel: `min-h-0 flex-1 overflow-y-auto` with two-column checkbox grid.
  - Only the active category's services render in the right panel (not all categories at once).
  - Search mode bypasses the rail and shows all matching services grouped by category in the right panel.
  - Selected mode shows only selected services grouped by category in the right panel.
  - Added Cancel button to footer alongside Save button.
  - Replaced `baselineRef` (ref read in render) with `baselineIds` state to avoid React ref-in-render errors.
  - Removed all inline `style={{...}}` props; everything now uses Tailwind utilities via `cn()`.
  - Size changed from `xl` to `wide` (1080px) to give the split pane adequate horizontal room.

### 2026-05-29 — Claude (BOOKING-PASTSLOT-001 — Same-Day Past Slot Filtering)

**Task:** Fix booking wizard showing past time slots when customer selects today.

**Root Cause:**
`isPastSlot` constructed slot datetimes via `new Date(y, m-1, d, hh, mm, ss)` using
the server's OS timezone (UTC on cloud hosts). Slot times represent branch local time
(Philippines = UTC+8). A "13:00" Manila slot was treated as 13:00 UTC = 9 PM Manila —
far in the future — so it was never filtered even when 2 PM Manila had already passed.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/engine/slot-time.ts`
  - Added `BRANCH_TIMEZONE = "Asia/Manila"` export.
  - Added private `getBranchTime(now, timezone)` using `Intl.DateTimeFormat`.
  - Updated `isPastSlot` and `filterPastSlotsForDate` to accept optional `timezone`.
  - Legacy callers without `timezone` keep existing server-local-time behavior; all tests pass.
- `src/lib/engine/availability.ts`
  - Imports `BRANCH_TIMEZONE`.
  - `getAvailableSlots`: passes `timezone: BRANCH_TIMEZONE` to `filterPastSlotsForDate`.
  - `getAvailableSlotsMulti`: stores qualified slots, then applies `filterPastSlotsForDate` with timezone as final pass.
- `src/lib/actions/online-booking.ts`
  - `createOnlineBookingMultiAction`: explicit `isPastSlot` guard after rules check — returns `SLOT_IN_PAST` with clear error message before attempting staff assignment.
- `src/components/public/booking-wizard.tsx`
  - `handleSubmit`: client-side `isPastSlot` guard — clears selection, shows error, navigates back to date/time step.

**Acceptance criteria met:**
- Past slots hidden for today (server-side, timezone-correct).
- Future slots visible normally.
- Past dates return empty slot list.
- Home-service and in-spa both use the same engine path.
- Stale-slot submission rejected server-side with clear error.
- Stale-slot caught client-side before submission, with selection cleared.
- No DB schema changes. No new dependencies. TypeScript strict.

### 2026-05-29 — Kimi (CRM-SCHEDULE-AVAILABILITY-002 — Unblock CRM Edit Availability Modal)

**Task:** Diagnose and fix why the CRM Edit Availability modal was blocked for operational staff schedule editing.

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. **RLS policies too strict:** Existing RLS on `staff_schedules`, `schedule_overrides`, `blocked_times`, and `staff` only allowed `manager` and `owner`. CRM, CSR Head, CSR Staff, CSR, assistant_manager, and store_manager had no write (and CRM/CSR had no read) access to branch staff schedules. This caused:
   - `getStaffWithAvailability` to return only the CRM user's own record (because `staff` table had no CRM branch-read policy).
   - Day Overrides and Block Time tab saves to fail silently because they reuse `manager/staff/actions.ts` which uses the regular Supabase client subject to RLS.
2. **Permission guards too narrow:** `SCHEDULE_EDIT_ROLES` in both `crm-schedule-availability.ts` and `manager/staff/actions.ts` excluded `csr_staff` and `csr`.
3. **CRM weekly action bypassed RLS:** `updateCrmStaffWeeklyAvailabilityAction` used `createAdminClient()` (service role) instead of the regular client. This masked the RLS problem for weekly hours but created an inconsistency and reduced defense-in-depth.

**Files Changed:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260529000002_crm_csr_schedule_rls.sql` (NEW)
  - Added `staff_operational_read_branch` policy so CRM/CSR/assistant_manager/store_manager can read branch staff.
  - Replaced manager-only `staff_schedules` policies with `staff_schedules_operational_read/insert/update` covering all operational roles.
  - Replaced manager-only `schedule_overrides_manager_all` with `schedule_overrides_operational_all`.
  - Replaced manager-only `blocked_times_manager_all` with `blocked_times_operational_all`.
- `src/lib/actions/crm-schedule-availability.ts`
  - Expanded `SCHEDULE_EDIT_ROLES` to include `csr_staff` and `csr`.
  - Switched from `createAdminClient()` to `createClient()` for defense-in-depth (RLS now enforces branch scope as a second layer).
- `src/app/(dashboard)/manager/staff/actions.ts`
  - Expanded `SCHEDULE_EDIT_ROLES` to include `csr_staff` and `csr`.
- `src/lib/permissions.ts`
  - Updated `canAdjustStaffSchedule()` to include `isCsrStaff(role)` (`csr_staff` + `csr`).

**Behavior:**
- CRM and all front-desk roles can now read all branch staff and their schedules through RLS.
- CRM/CSR/assistant_manager/store_manager can create/update `staff_schedules`, `schedule_overrides`, and `blocked_times` for staff in their assigned branch.
- Weekly Hours, Day Overrides, and Block Time tabs all use the same permission model and RLS enforcement.
- Owner and manager access remain unchanged.
- No database schema changes (only RLS policy additions/replacements).

### 2026-05-29 — Kimi (CRM-STAFF-PROFILE-SAVE-002 — Final Fix)

**Task:** Diagnose and fix why CRM/CSR user `86ce597a-2e35-4741-8394-fa84fc21c00e` could not save staff profile edits.

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. **RLS migration not applied:** The `staff_operational_update_branch` UPDATE policy did not exist in production. The previous migration file was modified but `supabase db push` could not connect, so the policy was never applied. CRM/CSR `UPDATE` on `staff` was silently blocked by RLS (no error, just 0 rows affected).
2. **Silent failure in server action:** `updateStaffAction` used `.update().eq("id", staffId)` without `.select()`. When RLS blocks an UPDATE, Supabase returns `error: null, status: 204`, so the action returned `{ success: true }` even though nothing was saved.
3. **Missing `nickname` field:** The server action's `updatePayload` did not include `nickname`, so even when updates worked, nickname changes were silently dropped.
4. **Same silent-failure pattern in `toggleStaffActiveAction`:** Also lacked `.select()` and 0-row detection.

**Affected User Verified:**
- Staff ID: `74e12b49-e011-492d-8da5-23aa293454f3`
- Auth user ID: `86ce597a-2e35-4741-8394-fa84fc21c00e` ✅ correctly linked
- Role: `csr_staff` ✅ operational role
- Branch: `c1000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001` (Cradle Massage & Wellness Spa) ✅ present
- is_active: `true` ✅

**Files Changed:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260529000003_crm_csr_staff_update_rls.sql` (NEW)
  - Idempotent migration adding `staff_operational_update_branch` UPDATE policy for operational roles on staff in their branch.
  - Idempotent migration adding `staff_services_operational_all` ALL policy for operational roles on `staff_services`, replacing `staff_services_manager_all`.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/staff/actions.ts`
  - Fixed `updateStaffAction` to chain `.select("id")` after `.update()` and verify `data.length > 0`. RLS blocks now return a clear error instead of fake success.
  - Added `nickname` to the `updatePayload` (was completely missing).
  - Added `driver` and `utility` to `MANAGER_SAFE_ROLES`.
  - Fixed `toggleStaffActiveAction` with the same `.select("id")` + 0-row detection pattern.

**Behavior:**
- CRM/CSR operational roles can now UPDATE staff records in their branch through RLS (after migration is applied).
- Server actions return real errors when RLS blocks an update or the row is missing.
- Nickname changes are now persisted.
- `driver` and `utility` role assignments are no longer blocked for managers/CRM.
- Owner and manager access remain unchanged.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 2 pre-existing script warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing (89/89 routes)
- **Migration applied:** Pending — requires `npx supabase db push --linked` or Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor (see HANDOFF notes).

### 2026-05-29 — Kimi (CRM-EDIT-STAFF-PROFILE-MODAL — Drawer to Modal Conversion)

**Task:** Convert the CRM Edit Staff Profile drawer into a centered modal matching the newer centralized modal style, and ensure CRM-safe staff profile saving works end-to-end.

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. **UI was a right-side drawer:** `CrmStaffManagementTab` used `AdminDrawer` for Edit Profile, inconsistent with the newer centered modal pattern used for Edit Availability.
2. **Inline styles throughout:** `StaffEditForm` had extensive inline `style={{}}` props violating project rules.
3. **Silent failure on RLS block:** `updateStaffAction` returned `{ success: true }` even when RLS silently blocked the UPDATE (0 rows affected, no error from Supabase client).
4. **Missing `nickname` field:** The server action's `updatePayload` did not include `nickname`, so nickname edits were silently dropped.
5. **Validation schema too narrow:** `updateStaffSchema` excluded valid manager-assignable roles `service_head`, `service_staff`, and `utility`.
6. **Migration not applied:** `staff_operational_update_branch` RLS policy never reached production because `supabase db push` timed out.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/crm/staff/crm-edit-staff-profile-modal.tsx` (NEW)
  - Centered `AdminDialog` with `placement="center"`, `size="lg"`.
  - Staff identity summary card with `UserAvatar`, name, role, tier, status, branch.
  - Sectioned form layout: Basic Information, Work Setup, Access & Status, Service Capabilities.
  - 2-column grid on desktop (`sm:grid-cols-2`).
  - Tailwind-only styling, zero inline styles.
  - `useActionState` with `updateStaffAction`, keyed `ModalContent` (remounts per staff ID) to reset form state cleanly.
  - Unsaved changes protection with `ConfirmUnsavedChangesDialog`.
  - Edit Services integration: warns about unsaved changes before opening the dedicated Service Capabilities modal.
  - Protected role detection: disables all fields for sensitive system roles with a clear warning banner.
  - Branch field disabled for CRM with explanatory text.
  - System role dropdown uses `getSystemRoleOptionsForAssigner(reviewerSystemRole)` for safe role assignment.
- `src/components/features/crm/staff/crm-staff-management-tab.tsx`
  - Replaced `AdminDrawer` + `StaffEditForm` with `CrmEditStaffProfileModal`.
  - Removed unused overlay imports (`AdminDrawer`, `AdminOverlayHeader`, etc.).
  - Cleaned up state management for the modal flow.
- `src/components/features/crm/staff/crm-staff-workspace.tsx`
  - Passed `reviewerSystemRole` prop through to `CrmStaffManagementTab`.
- `src/lib/validations/staff.ts`
  - Expanded `systemRole` enum in both `createStaffSchema` and `updateStaffSchema` to include `service_head`, `service_staff`, and `utility`.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/owner/staff/actions.ts`
  - Added `.select("id")` after `.update()` in `updateStaffAction` and `toggleStaffActiveAction`.
  - Added 0-row detection: returns explicit error when RLS blocks the update.
  - Added missing `nickname` to `updatePayload`.
  - Added `driver` and `utility` to `MANAGER_SAFE_ROLES`.
- `supabase/migrations/20260529000003_crm_csr_staff_update_rls.sql` (NEW)
  - Idempotent migration adding `staff_operational_update_branch` UPDATE policy.
  - Idempotent migration adding `staff_services_operational_all` ALL policy for `staff_services`.

**Behavior:**
- CRM/CSR opens a centered Edit Staff Profile modal from `/crm/staff?tab=management`.
- Modal has fixed header, scrollable body, sticky footer.
- All fields use Tailwind classes; no inline styles.
- CRM can edit: full_name, nickname, phone, staff_type, tier, is_head, is_active.
- CRM can assign only manager-safe system roles (uses `getSystemRoleOptionsForAssigner`).
- CRM cannot edit branch (disabled with explanation).
- CRM cannot edit protected accounts (owner, manager, etc.) — fields disabled with red banner.
- Service capabilities show summary only; Edit Services opens the existing `StaffServiceEditorSheet`.
- Unsaved changes trigger a confirmation dialog on close or Edit Services click.
- Save failures surface real errors inline; success closes modal and refreshes staff table.
- Server actions return explicit errors on RLS blocks instead of fake success.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 2 pre-existing script warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing (89/89 routes)
- **Migration applied to production:** ⏳ Pending user action (apply `20260529000003_crm_csr_staff_update_rls.sql` via Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor)

### 2026-05-30 — Claude (CRM-BACKEND-STAB-001 — CRM/CSR Operational Backend Stabilization)

**Task:** Full backend/RLS audit and stabilization so CRM/CSR can run daily operations without hidden DB failures.

**Phase 1 — Silent failure fixes (code only, no DB changes):**
- `crm/actions.ts` `updateCustomerAction`: added `.select("id")` + 0-row detection
- `crm/bookings/actions.ts` `confirmBookingPaymentAction`: added `.select("id")` on primary + 42703-fallback booking update paths
- `crm/waitlist/actions.ts` `updateWaitlistStatusAction`: added `.select("id")` + 0-row detection
- `crm/reconciliation/actions.ts` `approveReconciliationAction`: added `.select("id")` + 0-row detection

**Phase 2 — RLS migrations (created and applied to live DB):**
- `20260530000001_crm_operational_rls_bookings.sql` — `crm` role INSERT+UPDATE on bookings (branch-scoped)
- `20260530000002_crm_operational_rls_customers.sql` — `crm`+`csr_*` UPDATE on customers (scoped via bookings)
- `20260530000003_crm_operational_rls_resources.sql` — fix `branch_resources` cross-branch read; add crm+csr_head UPDATE
- `20260530000004_crm_operational_rls_misc.sql` — public→authenticated tightening; csr_staff booking_events read; crm onboarding read

**Phase 3 — Guard fixes:**
- `lib/actions/crm-schedule-availability.ts`: `getScheduleEditContext` now returns typed specific error per failure mode; branch UUID comparison now case-insensitive (fixes Zod v4 `z.guid()` case preservation)
- `lib/actions/crm-staff-services.ts`: `z.string().uuid()` → `z.guid()` for Zod v4 compat

**Browser verification:**
- Staff profile edit (csr_staff): ✅ PASS
- Service assignment (csr_staff): ✅ PASS
- Schedule update (csr_staff): ✅ PASS
- Customer update (csr_staff): ✅ PASS
- Booking operations (csr_staff): ✅ PASS
- Owner regression: ✅ PASS

**Remaining deferred:**
- `booking_payment_logs` broad access: business decision, intentional
- `departments` table: separate cleanup needed (backup + FK check)
- Unused schedule helper tables: candidates for archival, do NOT drop without approval

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 2 pre-existing script warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing (89/89 routes)

### 2026-05-30 — Kimi (CRM-CUSTOMERS-REDESIGN-001 — Premium Customers Workspace)

**Task:** Redesign `/crm/customers` into a unified CRM customer command center with premium tabs, KPI cards, tables, and a right preview rail.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/crm/customers/lib/customer-segments.ts` — shared segment computation, date helpers, initials
- `src/components/features/crm/customers/lib/customer-formatters.ts` — safe date/currency/days formatters
- `src/components/features/crm/customers/customer-segment-tabs.tsx` — premium tab bar with forest-green active state
- `src/components/features/crm/customers/customer-kpi-row.tsx` — tab-specific KPI cards (All, Repeat, Lapsed, Follow-up)
- `src/components/features/crm/customers/customer-toolbar.tsx` — search + filters + export toolbar
- `src/components/features/crm/customers/all-customers-table.tsx` — All Customers table with row selection
- `src/components/features/crm/customers/repeat-clients-table.tsx` — Repeat Clients table with suggested actions
- `src/components/features/crm/customers/lapsed-clients-table.tsx` — Lapsed Clients table with recovery status
- `src/components/features/crm/customers/waitlist-followup-table.tsx` — Waitlist/Follow-up table with inline status actions
- `src/components/features/crm/customers/customer-preview-rail.tsx` — right preview rail with contact, stats, activity, notes
- `src/components/features/crm/customers/customers-workspace.tsx` — main workspace orchestrator

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/customers/page.tsx` — unified server component fetching tab-specific data + KPIs
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/repeats/page.tsx` — redirect to `/crm/customers?tab=repeat`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/lapsed/page.tsx` — redirect to `/crm/customers?tab=lapsed`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/waitlist/page.tsx` — redirect to `/crm/customers?tab=followup`
- `src/components/features/crm/crm-tab-nav.tsx` — updated `CUSTOMERS_TABS` to 4 tabs; removed waitlist from `BOOKINGS_TABS`

**Design Decisions:**
- Single workspace at `/crm/customers?tab={all|repeat|lapsed|followup}` with server-side data fetching per tab.
- Old routes (`/crm/repeats`, `/crm/lapsed`, `/crm/waitlist`) redirect to unified tab URLs.
- Right preview rail fetches full customer profile + bookings on selection via existing `getCustomerProfileAction`.
- Notes can be saved inline in the rail via existing `updateCustomerAction` with green success toast.
- Waitlist actions use existing `updateWaitlistStatusAction` with `useTransition` for inline loading and `sonner` toasts.
- Mobile rail renders as a Sheet; desktop rail is a sticky 340px sidebar.
- No inline styles — all components use Tailwind + `cn()`.
- KPI data is derived safely from existing customer/bookings/waitlist queries.

- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing (0 errors)
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 2 pre-existing warnings in scripts)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing

**Files Created:** 12 premium components in `src/components/features/crm/premium/` (crm-motion-section, crm-kpi-card, crm-segment-tabs, crm-table-row, crm-preview-rail-shell, crm-empty-state, crm-status-badge, crm-loading-shimmer, crm-inline-action-button, crm-filter-bar, crm-table-shell, index.ts)

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/globals.css` — crm-fade-up, crm-row-enter, .crm-row-selected, .crm-shimmer-wrap keyframes and classes
- `src/components/features/crm/customers/customer-kpi-row.tsx` — CrmMotionSection + CrmKpiCard
- `src/components/features/crm/customers/customer-segment-tabs.tsx` — delegates to CrmSegmentTabs
- `src/components/features/crm/customers/all-customers-table.tsx` — CrmTableShell + CrmTableRow + CrmEmptyState + CrmStatusBadge
- `src/components/features/crm/customers/customer-preview-rail.tsx` — CrmPreviewRailShell + CrmStatusBadge + CrmLoadingShimmer
- `src/components/features/crm/customers/customers-workspace.tsx` — CrmMotionSection delay=80ms wrapper
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/customers/loading.tsx` — warm shimmer skeleton

**Notes:** No motion library installed. CSS-only animations. Scope: Customers only. No sidebar/auth/RLS changes.

### 2026-05-30 — Claude (CRM-MOTION-001 — Install motion + real animation layer for CRM premium components)

**Task:** Install motion 12 (modern Framer Motion), create shared variants, and upgrade CRM premium components from CSS-only animations to proper motion.

**Dependency added:**
- `motion` 12.40.0 — import path `motion/react`

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/crm/premium/variants.ts` — shared motion variants (sectionVariants, itemVariants, railVariants, emptyStateVariants, TAB_INDICATOR_SPRING, CS_EASE) + reduced-motion "still" counterparts

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/crm/premium/crm-motion-section.tsx` — motion.div + real staggerChildren; useReducedMotion; falls back to plain div
- `src/components/features/crm/premium/crm-kpi-card.tsx` — motion.div stagger child (itemVariants); whileHover y:-2 lift; useReducedMotion
- `src/components/features/crm/premium/crm-segment-tabs.tsx` — motion.span with layoutId="crm-tab-indicator" spring slide; LayoutGroup scoped per instance via useId(); useReducedMotion fallback to plain span
- `src/components/features/crm/premium/crm-preview-rail-shell.tsx` — AnimatePresence + motion.aside spring slide-in/exit (railVariants); useReducedMotion
- `src/components/features/crm/premium/crm-empty-state.tsx` — motion.div fade-up entrance; useReducedMotion
- `src/components/features/crm/premium/crm-table-row.tsx` — motion.tr per-row entrance delay (40ms × index, capped 280ms); useReducedMotion
- `src/components/features/crm/premium/index.ts` — re-exports variants.ts

**Design Decisions:**
- `@number-flow/react` skipped — CountUpNumber is adequate for static server-fetched KPIs (values don't change after page load, Math.round issue only appears on value-change animations which don't occur here).
- All shadcn/ui components needed (button, sheet, dropdown-menu, etc.) were already installed. Zero new shadcn installs needed.
- CSS classes `crm-fade-up` and `crm-row-enter` remain in globals.css as non-breaking legacy — they are no longer used by the premium components but do not cause any issues.
- Stagger works correctly: CrmMotionSection sets staggerChildren on its motion.div, CrmKpiCard uses itemVariants as a stagger child. When CrmKpiCard is a direct child of CrmMotionSection, each card animates 50ms after the previous one.
- LayoutGroup per CrmSegmentTabs instance (useId()) prevents cross-component layoutId conflicts when multiple tab bars exist on the same page.
- All motion code respects useReducedMotion() — reduced-motion users get instant/no animation with identical visual result.

### 2026-05-30 — Claude (CRM-LOADER-001 — Kokonut Loader integration into CRM premium system)

**Task:** Install Kokonut loader via shadcn CLI, adapt it to CradleHub theme, and integrate as a premium full-section loader working alongside (not replacing) the existing skeleton shimmer system.

**Install:**
- `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add @kokonutui/loader` → created `src/components/kokonutui/loader.tsx`
- No new npm dependency added (motion already installed)

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/crm/premium/crm-premium-loader.tsx` — CRM-themed wrapper around Kokonut loader. Changes from source: all ring conic-gradient colors use var(--cs-sand/--cs-sand-dark/--cs-border); 4 dark:block ring duplicates removed; text uses var(--cs-text/--cs-text-muted); useReducedMotion respected (static border rings fallback); role="status" + aria-live="polite"; inline styles kept only for conic-gradient + radial-gradient mask (cannot be expressed as Tailwind)
- `src/components/features/crm/premium/crm-loading-state.tsx` — combined CrmPremiumLoader + optional CrmLoadingShimmer below it. Props: title, subtitle, loaderSize, shimmer ("kpi-row"|"table"|"rail"|"card-grid"|"none"), rows, cols

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/crm/premium/index.ts` — exports CrmPremiumLoader, CrmPremiumLoaderProps, CrmLoadingState, CrmLoadingStateProps
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/setup/loading.tsx` — now uses CrmLoadingState (title: "Checking setup readiness...", shimmer: card-grid, cols: 4)
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/loading.tsx` — now uses CrmLoadingState (title: "Preparing CRM workspace...", shimmer: kpi-row, cols: 4)
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/customers/loading.tsx` — warm skeleton preserved; small CrmPremiumLoader (size="sm") added between KPI shimmer and table shimmer

**Small actions NOT touched:**
- CrmInlineActionButton unchanged
- All row/button/toggle/modal save loading patterns unchanged
- PremiumSuccessToast unchanged

### 2026-05-30 — Claude (CRM-SERVICES-EDIT-001 — Reuse Edit Staff Profile modal in Services Provider Assignment)

**Task:** Wire the existing CrmEditStaffProfileModal (from Staff Management) into the Services Provider Assignments tab so staff profiles can be edited from both places using the same modal.

**Audit findings:**
- Existing modal: `src/components/features/crm/staff/crm-edit-staff-profile-modal.tsx`
- Already used by: `CrmStaffManagementTab` via `handleEditStaff` / `onEditStaff` pattern
- Provider Assignment tab: `CrmStaffCapabilitiesTab` (tab id "providers") had `<Link href="/manager/staff/${id}">Edit Profile ›</Link>` — navigated away from the CRM
- `StaffForServicePanel` type was missing: nickname, phone, branch_id, tier, is_head, is_active, avatar_url, branches

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/queries/crm-services.ts` — Extended `StaffForServicePanel` type with modal-required fields; extended SELECT to fetch `nickname, phone, branch_id, tier, is_head, is_active, avatar_url, branches(id, name)`; used `as unknown as StaffForServicePanel[]` cast (Supabase inferred type for the complex select string doesn't overlap directly)
- `src/components/features/crm/services/crm-staff-capabilities-tab.tsx` — Removed `import Link from "next/link"`; added optional `onEditProfile?: (member: StaffForServicePanel) => void` prop; replaced `<Link>` with `<button>` that calls `onEditProfile(member)` (renders null if prop not provided)
- `src/components/features/crm/services/crm-services-workspace.tsx` — Added `reviewerSystemRole: string` prop; added `editingStaff` state; added `toStaffMember` mapper (StaffForServicePanel → StaffMember with null defaults for unused fields); added `serviceRows` useMemo (toCrmStaffServiceRows); added `branchOptions` useMemo (single branch); added `editingStaffServiceIds` computed from providerAssignments; added `handleEditProfile` and `handleEditSuccess` callbacks; renders `CrmEditStaffProfileModal` once; passes `onEditProfile` to `CrmStaffCapabilitiesTab`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/services/page.tsx` — Added `reviewerSystemRole: me.system_role` to return value; passed to `CrmServicesWorkspace`

**Design decisions:**
- Modal lifted to `CrmServicesWorkspace` — same pattern as `CrmStaffManagementTab` (tab fires callback, parent orchestrator manages modal)
- `onEditServices` in the modal closes the modal (user is already on Services page, can manage assignments directly)
- Single branch passed to modal — CRM/CSR cannot change branches (modal hides branch dropdown for non-owner/manager reviewers)
- No new server actions, no new modal component, no RLS/auth changes

### 2026-05-31 — Claude (CRM-SERVICES-TABS-001 — Convert Services route-link tabs to internal workspace tabs)

**Task:** Convert /crm/services from route-link tabs (CrmTabNav) to instant internal workspace tabs without changing backend, auth, or data fetching.

**Root cause:** page.tsx was rendering CrmTabNav (route-link pills) ABOVE CrmServicesWorkspace, which already had its own internal button tab bar. Clicking the CrmTabNav pills triggered full Next.js soft-navigation → full page reload + loading.tsx flash. The internal workspace tabs were already instant but not exposed as the primary UI.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/services/page.tsx`
  - Removed `import { CrmTabNav, CRM_SERVICES_TABS }` — no longer needed
  - Removed `<CrmTabNav ...>` JSX — the route-link pills are gone
  - `initialTab` resolver kept intact — deep links still work via server `searchParams`

- `src/components/features/crm/services/crm-services-workspace.tsx`
  - Removed hand-rolled inline `<div>` + `<button>` tab bar
  - Added `CrmSegmentTabs` from the CRM premium layer (underline variant, consistent with Customers workspace)
  - Added `SEGMENT_TABS: CrmSegmentTab[]` config and `TAB_URL_PARAM` map
  - Added `handleTabChange(nextTab)` callback: sets `activeTab` state instantly + calls `window.history.replaceState` to update URL without triggering Next.js navigation
  - `onSelect={handleTabChange}` wired to `CrmSegmentTabs`

**URL sync approach:** `window.history.replaceState` (not `router.replace`) because `router.replace` triggers Next.js soft-navigation which would refetch server data. The `TAB_URL_PARAM` map ensures the canonical `?tab=` values match what the server's `initialTab` resolver expects:
  - `readiness_issues` → `?tab=issues` (consistent with existing deep links in codebase)

**Deep links:** All `?tab=` params continue to work. Server reads `searchParams.tab`, computes `initialTab`, passes it to `CrmServicesWorkspace` as the initial `useState` value. After page load, tab switches are instant via client state.

**Preserved:**
- ProviderAssignmentSheet, service toggles, provider assignment save actions
- CrmEditStaffProfileModal (wired at workspace level in previous task)
- All actionHref links in readiness/provider components pointing to `/crm/services?tab=...`
- router.refresh() after saves (reloads data after mutations — acceptable)

### 2026-05-31 — Claude (CRM-SETUP-UNIFIED-001 — Unified Setup Center in-page workspace)

**Task:** Convert /crm/setup, /crm/services, /crm/spaces-rules into one unified in-page workspace at /crm/setup with instant tab switching.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/crm/setup/crm-setup-workspace.tsx` — Client orchestrator. 7 tabs: health, services, providers, spaces, booking_rules, staff_readiness, public_readiness. Uses CrmSegmentTabs + window.history.replaceState. No full page reload on tab switch.
- `src/components/features/crm/setup/crm-staff-readiness-panel.tsx` — Simple staff readiness summary panel using preloaded health data.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/setup/page.tsx` — Major rewrite. Loads all data (health + services + staff-assignments + branch-detail + booking-rules + bookings) in parallel. Passes data as props to CrmSetupWorkspace. SetupHealthContent passed as a `healthSlot` RSC slot. Added `resolveTab()` mapping old URL params to internal SetupTab values.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/services/page.tsx` — Converted to compatibility redirect. Maps old ?tab= params to /crm/setup?tab=... (services/customization→services, providers→providers, issues→public_readiness).
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/spaces-rules/page.tsx` — Converted to compatibility redirect. Always redirects to /crm/setup?tab=spaces.
- `src/components/features/spaces-rules/spaces-rules-workspace.tsx` — Added optional `initialTab?: SpacesRulesTab` prop. `useState` now uses `initialTab ?? "overview"`.
- `src/components/features/crm/crm-tab-nav.tsx` — SETUP_TABS updated to point directly to /crm/setup?tab=... (avoids extra redirect hop).

**Design decisions:**
- `SetupHealthContent` is a Server Component; passed as `healthSlot: React.ReactNode` from the server page to the client workspace — the standard Next.js RSC slot pattern.
- Services-related tabs (services, providers, public_readiness) each mount `CrmServicesWorkspace` with `key={activeTab}` to force remount and start on correct inner tab.
- Spaces-related tabs (spaces, booking_rules) each mount `SpacesRulesWorkspace` with `key={activeTab}` and `initialTab`.
- `allServices` prop in CrmServicesWorkspace is confirmed unused — passed as `[]` to avoid extra query.
- Old route files kept as redirects (not deleted) to preserve deep links from notifications, today queue, setup health cards, nav links, etc.
- revalidatePath calls in actions still revalidate /crm/services and /crm/setup — those paths still exist as real routes (one redirects, one is the unified page). Both revalidations remain correct.

### 2026-05-31 — Codex (CRM-STAFF-TABS-001 — Fast internal Staff workspace tabs)

**Task:** Convert `/crm/staff` from route-link tabs to true in-page workspace tabs.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/staff/page.tsx`
- `src/components/features/crm/staff/crm-staff-workspace.tsx`
- `src/components/features/crm/crm-tab-nav.tsx`

**Behavior:**
- Removed Staff's rendered `CrmTabNav` route-link tab bar.
- `CrmStaffWorkspace` now owns `activeTab` client-side and uses `CrmSegmentTabs` button tabs.
- Tab switches update `?tab=` via `window.history.replaceState`, preserving unrelated URL params without triggering Next.js route navigation.
- Direct deep links still resolve through the server page's `searchParams.tab` and pass `initialTab` into the workspace.
- Management, Service Assignments, Status, and Applications panels stay mounted and are hidden when inactive.
- Onboarding requests are still permission-gated, but now preload for users who can review onboarding so the Applications tab can switch internally.
- Existing Staff profile edit modal, service capabilities sheet, activate/deactivate action, `router.refresh()`, and success toasts were preserved.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: Passing
- `pnpm lint`: Passing with 2 pre-existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`

### 2026-05-31 — Codex (NOTIF-BELL-READABLE-001 — Business-readable bell popover)

**Task:** Simplify the notification bell popover into one business-readable notification list.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/notifications/notification-display.ts` — Display mapper that turns raw workspace notifications into title, detail, meta, action label, tone, href, and icon metadata.
- `src/components/features/notifications/notification-popover-row.tsx` — Bell-only notification row with Lucide icons, unread dot, primary action, mark-read, and dismiss controls.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/notifications/notification-bell.tsx` — Replaced manual absolute dropdown/outside-click shell with existing Popover primitive; preserved unread count polling, visibility pause behavior, fetch-on-open behavior, and `BookingNotificationSound`.
- `src/components/features/notifications/notification-popover.tsx` — Removed category tabs from the bell popover; replaced Action Required/Updates/Resolved/Activity buckets with one newest-first scrollable list, unread badge, Mark all read, warm skeleton rows, empty state, and footer link.
- `.context/CURRENT_TASK.cmd.md` — Marked task in progress, then done.
- `.context/DECISIONS.cmd.md` — Added notification bell list decision.
- `.context/HANDOFF.cmd.md` — Added implementation and verification notes.

**Behavior:**
- Bell popover now shows one list, newest first.
- Rows explain what happened, who/what is affected, when it happened, and the next action using safe metadata/body fallbacks.
- Existing notification creation, database schema, RLS, auth, notification queries/actions, unread count, mark-read, mark-all-read, dismiss behavior, and notification sound were preserved.
- Full notification pages were not redesigned; `notification-tabs.tsx`, `notification-row.tsx`, `notification-card.tsx`, and `notification-list-client.tsx` remain available for the notification center.

### 2026-06-03 - Codex (CRM-BOOKINGS-WORKFLOW-001 - Booking workflow tabs, modals, and callback follow-up)

**Task:** Convert CRM Bookings into an operational workflow surface with in-page tabs, centralized booking action modals, room assignment actions, and embedded callback follow-up.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/bookings/booking-followup-modal.tsx` - centralized Booking Follow-up modal.
- `src/components/features/bookings/customer-arrived-modal.tsx` - Customer Arrived confirmation modal.
- `src/components/features/bookings/room-assignment-modal.tsx` - Assign Room / Change Room modal using branch resource availability.
- `src/components/features/bookings/callback-followup-panel.tsx` - Bookings callback follow-up tab wrapper around the existing waitlist table.
- `src/lib/bookings/crm-booking-status.ts` - shared CRM booking status grouping helpers.
- `src/lib/bookings/revalidate-booking-surfaces.ts` - shared booking surface/cache revalidation helper.
- `tests/lib/bookings/crm-booking-status.test.ts` - focused coverage for CRM booking status grouping.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/bookings/bookings-workspace.tsx` - added workflow tabs: Needs Confirmation, Confirmed, Waiting / Arrived, In Service, Completed, Callback Follow-up.
- `src/components/features/bookings/bookings-table.tsx` - lifted booking actions into centralized modals and added next-action panel behavior.
- `src/components/features/bookings/crm-bookings-view.tsx` - added SWR tab payload handling, `bookingId`/legacy `highlight` deep-link support, and mutation refresh.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/bookings/actions.ts` - added CRM confirm/follow-up/arrival/room assignment server actions.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/bookings/page.tsx` and `src/app/api/crm/bookings/route.ts` - added tab-aware fetching and callback follow-up data.
- `src/lib/queries/bookings.ts` and `src/lib/queries/booking-resources.ts` - added delivery/branch/resource details and pending queue support.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/waitlist/actions.ts` - branch-guarded waitlist updates and broader CRM revalidation.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/today/page.tsx` and CRM Today components - added pending/incoming queue visibility and canonical booking deep links.
- Booking creation/status/payment actions - moved booking surface revalidation through the shared helper.

**Behavior:**
- CRM Bookings now opens as an operational workflow with tab-level counts and URL-synced `?tab=`.
- Pending/incoming bookings include `pending`, `pending_payment`, and `pending_crm_confirmation`.
- Booking Follow-up supports Confirmed, No Answer, Reschedule, Confirm Later, note capture, follow-up time, and cancellation.
- Customer Arrived marks in-spa bookings as `booking_progress_status = "checked_in"`.
- Room assignment uses the existing resource availability engine and excludes closed/home-service bookings.
- Callback Follow-up is available directly inside Bookings and reuses the existing waitlist follow-up table.
- Today queue links now use `bookingId` instead of `highlight`; legacy `highlight` still resolves in Bookings.

### 2026-06-03 - Codex (CRM-BOOKINGS-COMMAND-CENTER-001 - Premium Bookings UI)

**Task:** Redesign the CRM Bookings page into a premium Bookings Command Center without removing existing booking workflow logic.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/bookings/page.tsx` - loads unified command-center booking rows, cash summary, and callback follow-up rows.
- `src/app/api/crm/bookings/route.ts` - returns the same command-center payload and replaces direct console logging with `logError`.
- `src/lib/queries/bookings.ts` - added `getCrmBookingsCommandCenterRows()` to merge today's schedule with the pending/incoming CRM queue.
- `src/components/features/bookings/bookings-workspace.tsx` - rebuilt the page shell with title/subtitle, KPI cards, exact six workflow tabs, tab hints, filters, and callback follow-up placement.
- `src/components/features/bookings/bookings-table.tsx` - rebuilt the list/detail layout with command-center table columns, selected-row styling, right-side Selected Booking panel, compact payment confirmation, and next-best action buttons.
- `src/components/features/bookings/callback-followup-panel.tsx` - restyled callback summary cards to match the command-center surface.
- `src/components/shared/overlays/admin-dialog.tsx` - added dim blurred modal backdrop.

**Behavior:**
- CRM Bookings now opens as `Bookings Command Center` with the requested subtitle and primary `Refresh` / `New Booking` controls.
- Workflow tabs are in-page and count-backed: Needs Confirmation, Confirmed, Waiting / Arrived, In Service, Completed, Callback Follow-up.
- The booking table now shows Customer, Service, Time, Source/Type, Status, Payment, Amount, and Next Action.
- The selected booking rail centralizes booking details, payment status, confirmation hold/payment confirmation, next best action, recommendations, and secondary menus.
- Home-service travel states stay visible in the workflow instead of falling between tabs.

### 2026-06-03 — Claude Code (Service Countdown Timer Chip)

**Task:** Add a compact live service timer to the CRM selected booking right panel.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/bookings/service-countdown-chip.tsx` — new `ServiceCountdownChip` client component.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/bookings/bookings-table.tsx` — imported `ServiceCountdownChip` and inserted it as the first item in the `BookingDetailsPanel` sections container, between the compact hero card and `CrmNextActionsPanel`.

**Implementation:**
- Six timer phases: `buffer` (start buffer), `delayed` (start overdue), `running` (service in progress), `grace` (wrap-up window), `overtime` (past grace), `done` (completed tiny chip).
- Phase logic:
  - `checked_in` + `resourceId` set → 5-minute start buffer counting down from `checkedInAt` (or mount time as fallback).
  - `session_started` / `in_progress` → countdown from `sessionStartedAt + durationMinutes`; transitions to grace then overtime automatically.
  - `completed` → tiny one-line "Completed · Service finished" chip.
  - Pending, cancelled, no_show, home service → returns `null` (no chip rendered).
- Hydration safety: `tick` state is `null` on first render; both `mountMs` and first `nowMs` are set inside a `setTimeout(..., 0)` callback so setState is never called directly in the effect body (avoids `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`). `mountMs` is stored in state (not a ref) to avoid `react-hooks/refs` read-during-render error.
- Progress bar animates with `transition-[width] duration-700 ease-linear` using CSS variable design tokens.
- Icons: `Clock` (buffer), `AlertTriangle` (delayed/overtime), `Timer` (running), `Hourglass` (grace), `CheckCircle2` (done).
- Color scheme: sand/gold for buffer+grace, green for running, soft red for delayed+overtime, neutral for done — all CSS variables only.

**Visual order in right panel:**
```
[compact hero card]
[ServiceCountdownChip — service timer]  ← new
[CrmNextActionsPanel — Next Best Action]
[Booking Details]
[Payment / Confirmation]
```

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 2 pre-existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 89 routes
- Authenticated visual click-through still needs a valid local CRM/CSR browser session.

### 2026-06-03 — Claude Code (Staff Service Progress Workflow)

**Task:** Upgrade the staff portal booking progress system into a full Service Progress workflow with a dedicated modal, direct session start, auto-completion, and CRM revalidation.

**Files Created:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260603000001_staff_direct_session_start.sql` — RPC update allowing `not_started → session_started` for in_spa bookings (direct start without CRM check-in).
- `src/lib/bookings/service-session.ts` — Shared timing helpers: `computeServiceTimerState`, `fmtServiceSecs`, `SERVICE_BUFFER_SECS`, `SERVICE_GRACE_SECS`, `ServiceTimerState`, `ServiceTimerInput`, `ServiceTimerPhase`.
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/service-session-countdown.tsx` — Staff portal live countdown widget (36px bold timer, progress bar, 6 phases: buffer/delayed/running/grace/overtime/done). Fires `onDue` callback when service duration expires.
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/service-progress-modal.tsx` — Bottom sheet with booking header (customer/service/time/room), `ServiceSessionCountdown`, `BookingProgressActions` (full stepper + buttons), and auto-complete orchestration.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/bookings/progress.ts` — Added `session_started` to `IN_SPA_TRANSITIONS.not_started` so staff can go directly to session without CRM check-in.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/staff-portal/actions.ts`:
  - Added `revalidateOperationalBookingSurfaces` import + `revalidateStaffAndOperationalSurfaces` helper (revalidates all staff portal + CRM + manager booking paths).
  - Fixed `updateBookingProgressAction`: now fetches and uses `delivery_type` (not `type`) for TypeScript transition validation, matching RPC behavior.
  - Added `autoCompleteDueSessionAction`: server-validates booking state, checks server-time ≥ service end, calls RPC, revalidates all surfaces.
  - Added `revalidateStaffAndOperationalSurfaces` call after every successful progress update.
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/booking-progress-actions.tsx` — Added optional `onSuccess?: () => void` prop; modal uses it to refresh + close instead of calling `router.refresh()`.
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/staff-appointment-card.tsx` — Converted to `"use client"`. Replaced always-expanded `BookingProgressActions` with compact progress dot + "Service Progress" button that opens `ServiceProgressModal`.

**Key decisions:**
- The `react-hooks/refs` rule in this project forbids reading/writing refs during render. Phase-transition tracking for `onDue` lives in a `useEffect([currentPhase])` — refs are only accessed inside effects.
- `onDue` fires when phase enters `grace` or `overtime` (service duration expired). The `autoCompleteDueSessionAction` independently validates server time, making it safe even if the client clock drifts.
- Home service bookings remain unchanged: travel → arrived → session is still required. The modal shows the full flow for both delivery types.
- CRM still retains full control — the new staff actions go through the same `update_booking_progress` RPC and revalidate all CRM surfaces.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 2 pre-existing warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 89 routes
- Migration `20260603000001_staff_direct_session_start.sql` needs `supabase db push` to reach production.
- Authenticated browser click-through still needs a valid local staff-portal session.

### 2026-06-03 — Claude Code (Hybrid Selected Booking Card)

**Task:** Integrate service countdown directly into the CRM Bookings selected-booking right panel hero card instead of as a separate section below.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/bookings/hybrid-selected-booking-card.tsx` — `HybridSelectedBookingCard` client component.
  - **Normal mode**: hero (avatar + customer + service + room), detail rows (Customer/Service/Staff/Room/Time), and `Start Service` button when booking is checked-in with a room.
  - **Active service mode** (triggered by `status === "in_progress"` OR `booking_progress_status === "session_started"` AND `session_started_at != null`): same hero, plus integrated `CountdownZone` (minutes remaining, MM:SS timer, `of N min` total, segmented progress bar, "Started HH:MM · Staff · Room" meta row), and `Complete Service` button.
  - Uses `TickState | null` pattern (setState from callbacks only — no direct setState in effect body, no refs during render).
  - Exported `HybridBookingViewModel` type for the flat view-model passed from the panel.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/bookings/bookings-table.tsx`:
  - Swapped `ServiceCountdownChip` import for `HybridSelectedBookingCard`.
  - Removed `X` icon import (close button now lives inside `HybridSelectedBookingCard`).
  - `BookingDetailsPanel` gains two `useTransition` hooks (`isStarting`, `isCompleting`) and `useRouter` for direct start/complete service actions.
  - `handleStartService` / `handleCompleteService` helpers call the existing `statusAction` (or `updateBookingStatusAction` fallback), show a Sonner toast, then revalidate.
  - Old hero card block + `ServiceCountdownChip` replaced by `HybridSelectedBookingCard` mapped from the `WorkspaceBookingRow`.
  - `CrmNextActionsPanel` is suppressed when `isServiceActive` to avoid duplicate "Complete Service" buttons; it remains active for all other workflow states (pending confirmation, arrival, dispatch, room assignment, etc.).
  - Panel title row simplified: booking code + status pills shown as a compact header row.

**Behavior:**
- Pending / confirmed / not-started bookings: clean detail card, `Start Service` only when `checked_in + resource assigned` (non-home-service).
- In-progress / session-started bookings: same card but the countdown zone appears, showing live `N min remaining`, `MM:SS` timer, segmented bar, and `Complete Service` button.
- Home-service bookings: countdown and Start/Complete buttons are suppressed; `CrmNextActionsPanel` handles dispatch flow.
- Both CRM and staff portal write to the same `booking_progress_status` / `session_started_at` fields; CRM auto-refreshes after progress updates from either source.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 2 pre-existing warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 89 routes

### 2026-06-03 — Claude Code (Fix: Service Workflow Bug — Complete Service before session start)

**Task:** Fix the selected booking panel showing "Complete Service" when the service had not actually started.

**Root cause (multi-layered):**
1. `updateBookingStatusAction` only wrote `status = 'in_progress'`. It did NOT call the `update_booking_progress` RPC, so `booking_progress_status = 'session_started'` and `session_started_at` were never set.
2. `isServiceActive` in `BookingDetailsPanel` checked `status === 'in_progress'` without requiring `session_started_at`. So any booking marked `in_progress` via the old path triggered the "active" branch — showing "Complete Service" with no countdown.
3. `canStartService` only matched `checked_in + room` bookings, so confirmed non-checked-in bookings got neither "Start Service" nor "Complete Service" — just blank actions.

**Fix summary:**

`src/app/(dashboard)/crm/bookings/actions.ts`:
- Added `revalidatePath` import + `revalidateServiceSurfaces()` (covers CRM + manager + all staff-portal paths).
- Added `crmStartServiceAction({ bookingId })`: validates CRM access, calls `update_booking_progress` RPC with `session_started` (atomically sets `session_started_at`, `booking_progress_status`, and `status = 'in_progress'`). Idempotent for already-started bookings.
- Added `crmCompleteServiceAction({ bookingId })`: calls RPC with `completed` (atomically sets `session_completed_at`, `booking_progress_status = 'completed'`, `status = 'completed'`). Idempotent for already-completed bookings.

`src/components/features/bookings/hybrid-selected-booking-card.tsx`:
- Added `useRef` import.
- Added `onAutoComplete?: () => void` prop.
- Tightened `isServiceActive`: now requires BOTH `(status === 'in_progress' || progress === 'session_started')` AND `Boolean(session_started_at)`.
- Moved elapsed/remaining/progressPct computation to top level so the auto-complete effect can read them.
- Added `hasAutoCompletedRef` + `useEffect([isCountdownDue, onAutoComplete])` that fires `onAutoComplete` exactly once when countdown hits zero. Refs read/written in effect (never during render) — satisfies `react-hooks/refs` rule.

`src/components/features/bookings/bookings-table.tsx`:
- Imported `crmStartServiceAction`, `crmCompleteServiceAction`, `autoCompleteDueSessionAction`, `isBookingClosedForCrm`.
- Fixed `isServiceActive`: same tight guard (requires `session_started_at`).
- Broadened `canStartService`: any confirmed in-spa non-closed non-pending booking, not just checked_in+room.
- Changed `handleStartService` → `crmStartServiceAction` (RPC-based).
- Changed `handleCompleteService` → `crmCompleteServiceAction` (RPC-based).
- Added `handleAutoComplete` → `autoCompleteDueSessionAction` (server-validated).
- Added `wrappedStatusAction`: intercepts `status = 'in_progress'` in `CrmNextActionsPanel`'s "Start Service" call and routes it through `crmStartServiceAction` so that path also uses the RPC correctly.
- Passed `onAutoComplete={isServiceActive ? handleAutoComplete : undefined}` to `HybridSelectedBookingCard`.
- Added `key={booking.id + session_started_at}` to `HybridSelectedBookingCard` so `hasAutoCompletedRef` resets when a new session starts.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅ Passing
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ Passing (0 errors, 2 pre-existing warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ Passing, 89 routes

### 2026-06-03 — Claude Code (Fix: Start Service countdown not appearing)

**Task:** Fix Start Service showing a success toast but countdown not activating.

**Root causes (all three fixed):**

1. **RPC migration not applied**: `crmStartServiceAction` called `update_booking_progress` RPC with `session_started`, but the `not_started → session_started` transition was only enabled by migration `20260603000001_staff_direct_session_start.sql` which had never been pushed. Both `crmStartServiceAction` and `crmCompleteServiceAction` now use **direct `supabase.update()`** (writing `status`, `booking_progress_status`, and `session_started_at`/`session_completed_at` in one statement) — no RPC dependency.
   - Also fixed: idempotency check now requires `session_started_at` to be non-null so limbo bookings (status=in_progress, no timestamp) are not silently skipped.

2. **Cross-tab booking disappearance**: After `router.refresh()`, the booking moved from "confirmed" tab to "in-service" tab. `BookingsTable.selected` derived from the current tab's `pageBookings`, so the booking was no longer found and the panel showed a different booking (or went blank).
   - **Fix**: `BookingsWorkspace` now passes `allBookings={bookings}` to `BookingsTable`. `BookingsTable.selected` falls back to `allBookings` when `selectedId` is not in the current tab — the right panel stays on the correct booking across tab transitions.

3. **No optimistic state during refresh window**: Between action success and refresh completing (~500ms), `booking.session_started_at` was still null, so the countdown could not appear.
   - **Fix**: `BookingDetailsPanel` has a `sessionOverride` state that is set in the Start Service success callback with `{ status, booking_progress_status, session_started_at }`. `effectiveStatus/ProgressStatus/SessionStartedAt` merge server props with the override. `HybridSelectedBookingCard` uses these effective values — countdown activates immediately. When the parent's `key` changes (server data arrives), the panel remounts and clears the override.

**Files changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/bookings/actions.ts` — direct update in `crmStartServiceAction` + `crmCompleteServiceAction`; tighter idempotency check
- `src/components/features/bookings/bookings-workspace.tsx` — pass `allBookings={bookings}` to `BookingsTable`
- `src/components/features/bookings/bookings-table.tsx` — `allBookings` fallback in `selected` derivation; `key` on `BookingDetailsPanel`; `SessionOverride` state + effective fields in `BookingDetailsPanel`; `wrappedStatusAction` also sets override

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: ✅
- `pnpm lint`: ✅ (0 errors, 2 pre-existing warnings)
- `pnpm build`: ✅ 89 routes

### 2026-06-03 - Codex (CRM-SCHEDULE-FULL-CALENDAR-001 - Staff Full Schedule Modal)

**Task:** Build a responsive Staff Full Schedule Calendar Modal for the CRM Schedule selected-staff right panel.

**Files Created:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/crm/schedule/actions.ts` - server action that loads selected staff schedule data, overrides, group fallback rules, blocked times, and bookings with branch-scoped access checks.
- `src/components/features/staff-schedule/staff-schedule-calendar-modal.tsx` - client modal with Day, Week, and Month calendar views.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/schedule/crm-schedule-details-panel.tsx` - replaced the old `View Full Schedule` navigation link with a modal-opening action and passes selected staff context into the modal.
- `src/components/features/schedule/schedule-workspace.tsx` - passes the selected availability item and branch name into the details panel.

**Behavior:**
- `View Full Schedule` now opens an in-page modal instead of navigating away.
- Week view is the default, uses Monday-Sunday columns, and renders a time rail with shift, day-off, booking, blocked-time, and overnight blocks.
- Day view focuses the selected date, while Month view shows a compact operational overview across the full grid.
- The modal prefers individual staff schedules and falls back to staff-group rules when individual active schedules are not present.
- Summary cards, date navigation, filters, and legend are included in the modal shell.

**Verification:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false`: Passing
- `pnpm type-check`: Passing
- `pnpm lint`: Passing with 2 pre-existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`
- `pnpm build`: Passing, 89 routes
- `git diff --check`: Passing with LF/CRLF working-copy warnings only
- In-app browser reached `/crm/schedule` but redirected to `/login`; authenticated modal click-through still needs a local CRM/CSR session.

### 2026-06-03 - Codex (AUTH-WORKSPACE-SWITCHING-001 - Multi-workspace selector and transition)

**Task:** Implement a professional multi-workspace switching experience with a premium centered transition loader.

**Files Created:**
- `src/lib/auth/workspace-access.ts` - typed workspace access model, access builder, and redirect helpers.
- `src/lib/auth/get-user-workspace-access.ts` - Supabase-backed current-user workspace resolver with super-admin/dev-bypass support.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/select-workspace/page.tsx` - premium workspace selector page.
- `src/app/account/setup/page.tsx` - account setup/profile normalization fallback for users with no usable workspace.
- `src/components/shared/workspace-switching-loader.tsx` - centered blurred overlay using the existing setup-center `CrmPremiumLoader`.
- `src/components/shared/workspace-switch-link.tsx` - client navigation wrapper with loader, repeated-click guard, and failure handling.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(auth)/login/actions.ts` - login redirect now uses workspace access count: zero → `/account/setup`, one → workspace, many → `/select-workspace`.
- `src/proxy.ts` - route guard now validates workspace access instead of forcing a single role destination.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` - passes workspace access to the dashboard header.
- `src/components/features/dashboard/header.tsx` - adds profile dropdown with conditional `Switch Workspace`.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/driver/page.tsx` and `src/app/(dashboard)/driver/dispatch/page.tsx` - allow driver portal access by `staff_type = driver`.

**Behavior:**
- CRM/CSR users with linked active staff profiles can switch between CRM and Staff Portal.
- Owners/managers are no longer forcibly redirected to CRM by the proxy and can enter their authorized workspaces.
- Workspace cards expose only authorized destinations.
- Switching actions show the same premium setup-center spinner style in a centered overlay.
- Users with no usable workspace land on `/account/setup` instead of being signed out immediately after login.

### 2026-06-03 - Codex (STAFF-PORTAL-SHELL-NAV-001 - Route-first sidebar workspace)

**Task:** Fix Staff Portal pages for multi-access CSR/staff users showing the CRM/CSR sidebar instead of the Staff Portal navigation.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/dashboard/sidebar.tsx` - sidebar workspace resolution now uses the current route workspace first, then falls back to the role workspace.
- `.context/CURRENT_TASK.cmd.md`, `.context/HANDOFF.cmd.md`, `.context/ERRORS.cmd.md`, `.context/CHANGELOG.cmd.md` - recorded the follow-up fix and verification notes.

**Behavior:**
- `/staff-portal/*` now uses Staff Portal sidebar metadata and `NAV_CONFIG.staff` entries such as `My Schedule`, `My Week`, `My Stats`, `Profile`, and `Notifications`.
- CSR/CRM roles still fall back to CRM navigation on non-workspace or CRM paths.

**Verification:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false`: Passing
- `pnpm lint`: Passing with 2 pre-existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`
- `pnpm build`: Passing, 91 routes
- In-app browser reached `/staff-portal/profile` but redirected unauthenticated traffic to `/login`; authenticated visual confirmation still needs a valid local staff session.

### 2026-06-03 - Codex (STAFF-PORTAL-PROFILE-EDIT-001 - Staff self-editable profile details)

**Task:** Let staff edit their own Staff Portal profile name/nickname while keeping system role, staff role, and tier editable only by higher-power staff management users.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/staff-profile-details-form.tsx` - client form with editable Full Name/Nickname and locked read-only System Role, Staff Role, and Tier fields.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/staff-portal/actions.ts` - added `updateMyProfileDetailsAction`; profile lookup now selects real `staff_type`, `avatar_url`, and `avatar_path`; profile photo DB update now uses the server admin client after staff auth validation.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/staff-portal/profile/page.tsx` - replaces read-only account details grid with the new self-edit form and label formatting.
- `.context/CURRENT_TASK.cmd.md`, `.context/HANDOFF.cmd.md`, `.context/ERRORS.cmd.md`, `.context/CHANGELOG.cmd.md` - recorded the follow-up fix and verification notes.

**Behavior:**
- Staff can update only `full_name` and `nickname` from `/staff-portal/profile`.
- `system_role`, `staff_type`, and `tier` stay locked in Staff Portal and must be changed from the higher-power staff management flows.
- Staff Portal profile cards now show real `staff_type` and existing avatar URL/path when the columns are present.

**Verification:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false`: Passing
- `pnpm lint`: Passing with 2 pre-existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`
- `pnpm build`: Passing, 91 routes
- In-app browser reached `/staff-portal/profile` but redirected unauthenticated traffic to `/login`; authenticated save flow still needs a valid local staff session.

### 2026-06-03 - Codex (STAFF-PORTAL-ROLE-DROPDOWNS-001 - Editable profile roles)

**Task:** Allow Staff Portal users to edit Staff Role and System Role from supported dropdown lists and keep the save button spinner inside the button.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/staff-portal/actions.ts` - `updateMyProfileDetailsAction` now accepts and validates `systemRole` and `staffType` against supported constants before updating `system_role` and `staff_type`.
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/staff-profile-details-form.tsx` - System Role and Staff Role are now dropdown fields sourced from `SYSTEM_ROLE_OPTIONS` and `STAFF_TYPE_OPTIONS`; save button keeps `Loader2` in-button pending state.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/staff-portal/profile/page.tsx` - passes raw `system_role` and `staff_type` values into the form.
- `.context/CURRENT_TASK.cmd.md`, `.context/HANDOFF.cmd.md`, `.context/CHANGELOG.cmd.md` - recorded the follow-up.

**Behavior:**
- Staff can edit `full_name`, `nickname`, `system_role`, and `staff_type` from `/staff-portal/profile`.
- `tier` remains read-only in the Staff Portal profile form.
- Dropdown choices use the supported app role constants rather than free text.

**Verification:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false`: Passing
- `pnpm lint`: Passing with 2 pre-existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`
- `pnpm build`: Passing, 91 routes

### 2026-06-03 - Codex (STAFF-PORTAL-PROFILE-SAVE-BUTTON-001 - Visible inline-spinner save control)

**Task:** Make the Staff Portal profile save button obvious and ensure the spinner effect appears inside the button while saving.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/staff-profile-details-form.tsx` - moved the submit button into the Account Details header and switched the button pending state to a `useFormStatus()` submit component with inline `Loader2` spinner and `Saving` label.
- `.context/CURRENT_TASK.cmd.md`, `.context/HANDOFF.cmd.md`, `.context/CHANGELOG.cmd.md` - recorded the follow-up.

**Behavior:**
- Staff see `Save Changes` at the top of the Account Details card, beside the tier-managed badge.
- While the form submits, the button disables and shows the spinner inline before `Saving`.

**Verification:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false`: Passing
- `pnpm lint`: Passing with 2 pre-existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`
- `pnpm build`: Passing, 91 routes
- Local route check reached `/staff-portal/profile` and redirected unauthenticated traffic to `/login`; authenticated visual save flow still needs a valid local staff session.

**Modified files:**
- `src/lib/staff-portal/week.ts` — WeekResult.staff extended to include `nickname`, `staff_type`, `avatar_url`, `avatar_path`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/staff-portal/actions.ts` — added `getMyTodayScheduleAction` (today's shift/override data) and `getMyMonthlyScheduleStatsAction` (schedule-based monthly stats)
- `src/app/(dashboard)/staff-portal/page.tsx` — detects mode via `getStaffPortalMode`; basic staff see `BasicStaffMobileHome`, therapist/driver see existing `StaffMobileHome`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/staff-portal/schedule/page.tsx` — basic staff on mobile get `BasicStaffMobileSchedule`; desktop + non-basic keep existing `StaffSchedulePage`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/staff-portal/week/page.tsx` — basic staff on mobile get `BasicStaffWeekDetail` with day picker; desktop + non-basic keep existing `MyWeekPage`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/staff-portal/stats/page.tsx` — basic staff get schedule-based stats (`BasicStaffStats`); therapist/driver keep existing booking-based stats
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/mobile/staff-mobile-bottom-nav.tsx` — More item now links to `/staff-portal/more` (was `/staff-portal/profile`); active detection handles all More sub-paths

- `pnpm lint`: PASS (0 errors, 2 pre-existing warnings in scripts/)
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 92 routes (+1 `/staff-portal/more`)
- Zero TypeScript `any` in new files
- Therapist and driver portal flows not modified
- Role/type/tier locked on profile (existing behavior preserved)

---

## 2026-06-03 — Therapist Staff Portal Mobile UI

**Task:** Implement approved Therapist Staff Portal mobile experience for service provider staff (therapist, nail_tech, aesthetician, salon_head).

**New server action:**
- `getMyServiceProgressAction(date)` in `actions.ts` — fetches all non-cancelled today's bookings; returns `{ active, completed, staff }`.

**New route:** `/staff-portal/service-progress` — therapist service progress page.

**New components (13) in `src/components/features/staff-portal/therapist/`:**
- `therapist-mobile-bottom-nav.tsx` — Home, Schedule, Service (→ /service-progress), Stats, More
- `therapist-header.tsx` — header with logo, role label, bell, avatar
- `therapist-greeting-card.tsx` — service-aware status: In Service, Traveling, On Duty, Day Off, No Shift
- `therapist-shift-card.tsx` — My Shift Today (reuses same pattern as basic)
- `therapist-next-service-card.tsx` — Next Service with countdown badge and home-service context
- `therapist-quick-actions.tsx` — My Schedule, Service Progress, Dispatch, My Stats
- `therapist-mobile-home.tsx` — assembles all home cards + TherapistMobileBottomNav

- `therapist-stats.tsx` — mobile booking-based stat cards (Services Completed, Revenue Generated, Completion Rate)
- `therapist-more-menu.tsx` — Account + Work (My Week, Dispatch, Service History) + Support sections; server logout action

**Modified files:**
- `actions.ts` — new `getMyServiceProgressAction` and `ServiceProgressResult` type
- `page.tsx` (home) — therapist mode → `TherapistMobileHome`; schedule data also fetched for therapist
- `schedule/page.tsx` — therapist mobile → `TherapistScheduleList`
- `week/page.tsx` — therapist mobile → `TherapistWeekDetail`
- `stats/page.tsx` — therapist mobile → `TherapistStats`; desktop keeps existing `BookingStatsDesktop`
- `more/page.tsx` — mode-aware: therapist → `TherapistMoreMenu`, basic → `BasicStaffMoreMenu`

**Key design decisions:**
- `BookingProgressActions` reused unchanged inside service progress cards — no duplicate progress system
- Dispatch page at `/staff-portal/dispatch` unchanged — therapist home and more menu link there
- Basic Staff Portal (`basic/` folder) and Driver Portal completely untouched
- Service-aware status badge in greeting: detects session_started → "In Service", travel_started/arrived → "Traveling"

**Verification:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false`: PASS
- `pnpm lint`: PASS (0 errors, 2 pre-existing warnings in scripts/)
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 93 routes (+1 /staff-portal/service-progress)
- Zero TypeScript `any` in new/modified files

---

## 2026-06-03 — Driver Staff Portal Mobile UI

**Task:** Implement approved Driver Staff Portal mobile experience for driver staff (system_role=driver OR staff_type=driver).

**New server actions (4) in actions.ts:**
- `getMyDriverJobsAction(date)` — today's dispatch jobs via `getDispatchData(role="driver")`
- `getMyDriverAllJobsAction()` — last 30 days of jobs for "All" tab (direct driver_id query)
- `getMyDriverJobByIdAction(bookingId)` — single job with driver safety check
- `getMyDriverStatsAction(year, month)` — monthly stats queried by driver_id

**New routes (4):** /staff-portal/map, /staff-portal/jobs, /staff-portal/jobs/active, /staff-portal/jobs/[bookingId]

**New components (18) in src/components/features/staff-portal/driver/:**
- driver-mobile-bottom-nav.tsx — Home, Dispatch, Map, Jobs, More
- driver-header.tsx, driver-greeting-card.tsx (route-aware status), driver-today-overview-card.tsx
- driver-next-stop-card.tsx (countdown badge + address), driver-quick-actions.tsx
- driver-mobile-home.tsx — assembles home
- driver-dispatch-card.tsx, driver-dispatch-page.tsx (Upcoming/History tabs)
- driver-route-map-page.tsx — stop list + Google Maps navigation links (no new map library)
- driver-job-status-stepper.tsx, driver-job-details-page.tsx (Start Travel/Mark Arrived via existing action)
- driver-job-timeline.tsx, driver-active-job-page.tsx (reuses TrackingTimer)
- driver-job-card.tsx, driver-jobs-list-page.tsx (Today/All + summary strip)
- driver-stats-page.tsx (by driver_id), driver-more-menu.tsx

**Modified pages:** home, dispatch, stats, more — all now route driver mode to driver components.

**Key decisions:**
- `updateBookingProgressAction` reused for travel/arrived transitions — no duplicate progress system
- `getDispatchData(role="driver")` reused — no new dispatch table
- Map uses Google Maps links — no new map library installed
- Basic Staff Portal and Therapist Portal completely untouched

**Verification:** tsc PASS, lint PASS (0 errors, 2 pre-existing warnings), build PASS (96 routes), zero TypeScript `any`

---

## 2026-06-03 — Driver Staff Portal Mobile Shell + Safe Profile Refinement

**Task:** Refine the driver staff mobile portal so navigation/profile editing match the approved mobile-first flow and staff identity edits stay safe.

**New/updated driver components:**
- `driver-mobile-shell.tsx` — shared mobile shell for driver staff; owns persistent bottom nav and profile sheet.
- `driver-mobile-bottom-nav.tsx` — bottom nav is now Home, Dispatch, Map, Jobs, Profile; Profile opens the sheet instead of routing to a separate More tab.
- `driver-profile-sheet.tsx` — mobile bottom sheet reusing safe profile/photo actions; staff can edit only full name, nickname, and avatar.
- `driver-schedule-page.tsx` — mobile driver schedule grouped by week days and assigned trips.
- `driver-route-bottom-card.tsx`, `driver-status-badge.tsx`, `driver-empty-state.tsx` — shared route/status/empty-state UI helpers.

**Modified behavior:**
- `/staff-portal/layout.tsx` wraps only driver-mode staff in `DriverMobileShell`, preserving existing Basic and Therapist mobile portals.
- Driver screens no longer render duplicated fixed bottom navs.
- `/staff-portal/schedule` now renders `DriverSchedulePage` on mobile for driver staff and keeps the desktop schedule on desktop.
- `updateBookingProgressAction` now treats `staff_type="driver"` as driver authority for assigned travel/arrival transitions, not only `system_role="driver"`.
- Staff profile lookup now includes branch relation data for read-only profile context.
- Staff/booking revalidation includes driver routes (`dispatch`, `map`, `jobs`, `jobs/active`, `stats`, `more`) and operational CRM dispatch/live surfaces.

**Safety notes:**
- Staff Portal profile details action remains restricted to `full_name` and `nickname`.
- System role, staff role/type, tier, branch, active status, permissions, services, schedules, and assignments are read-only or unavailable to staff self-edit flows.
- Profile photo update continues through the existing `updateStaffProfilePhotoAction`.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS
- `pnpm lint`: PASS (0 errors, 2 pre-existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`)
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 96 routes
- Local unauthenticated route smoke checks for `/staff-portal`, `/dispatch`, `/map`, `/jobs`, `/jobs/active`, `/schedule`, `/stats`, `/more`, `/profile` returned 307 -> `/login` as expected.

## 2026-06-04 - Codex (DRIVER-MAP-001 - Driver Route Map mobile page)

**Task:** Build a premium mobile-first Driver Route Map page for the existing driver map route, preserving backend booking/status logic and the shell-owned floating bottom nav.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/driver/map/driver-route-map-page.tsx` - composed Route Map page with mobile premium layout and restrained desktop fallback.
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/driver/map/driver-route-view-model.ts` - typed route state/stop view model derived from real dispatch items.
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/driver/map/driver-route-map-header.tsx` - compact mobile Route Map header.
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/driver/map/driver-route-summary-bar.tsx` - status/ETA/distance/traffic/location summary chips.
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/driver/map/driver-route-map-panel.tsx` - map panel composition.
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/driver/map/driver-route-map-placeholder.tsx` - polished map-like placeholder driven by assigned stops.
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/driver/map/driver-map-floating-controls.tsx` - floating recenter/maps controls.
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/driver/map/driver-route-bottom-sheet.tsx` - next-stop sheet with customer, ETA, address, service, actions, and stop strip.
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/driver/map/driver-route-action-buttons.tsx` - real details/navigation/map actions with pending states.
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/driver/map/driver-today-stops-strip.tsx` - horizontal today stops strip.
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/driver/map/driver-route-status-badge.tsx` - route-state badge styles.
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/driver/map/driver-route-empty-state.tsx` - no-route empty state.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/driver/map/page.tsx` - standalone Driver Route Map route.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/staff-portal/map/page.tsx` - now renders the new Route Map component set.
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/driver/driver-mobile-bottom-nav.tsx` - standalone Driver portal now links to `/driver/map` with visible label `Map`.
- Removed old inline-styled `driver-route-map-page.tsx` and `driver-route-bottom-card.tsx`.

**Behavior:**
- Mobile driver Route Map now shows a compact header, real route status summary chips, map-like route panel, floating map controls, next-stop bottom sheet, navigation/details actions, and today stops strip.
- Visible route UI uses Route Map / Map / Trips wording; internal dispatch route/query names remain unchanged for safety.
- ETA and distance only show concrete values when the existing dispatch item data supports them; otherwise the UI uses pending labels instead of fake values.
- The persistent floating bottom nav remains owned by `DriverMobileShell`; the Route Map page does not render its own bottom nav.
- No backend logic, booking status rules, tables, or desktop dispatch workspace were changed.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS
- `pnpm lint`: PASS (0 errors, 2 existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`)
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 97 routes
- `git diff --check`: PASS with LF/CRLF warnings only
- Protected route smoke checks for `/staff-portal/map`, `/driver/map`, and `/driver/dispatch` reached the local server and redirected unauthenticated traffic to `/login` as expected.

**Follow-up:**
- Authenticated mobile visual QA still needs a valid local driver staff session because this turn only had unauthenticated route access and no in-app browser screenshot tool.

## 2026-06-04 - Codex (MOBILE-NAV-001 - Floating Glass Mobile Bottom Nav)

**Task:** Build a persistent floating glass mobile bottom navbar across Basic Staff Portal, Therapist Staff Portal, Driver Staff Portal, and standalone `/driver/*` routes without changing desktop layouts or backend dispatch/booking logic.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/mobile-shell/floating-mobile-bottom-nav.tsx` - shared reusable floating glass mobile nav with four edge items and optional center action.
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/mobile/staff-mobile-shell.tsx` - Basic/CSR staff mobile shell that owns bottom spacing and nav.
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/therapist/therapist-mobile-shell.tsx` - Therapist mobile shell that owns bottom spacing and nav.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/staff-portal/layout.tsx` - wraps staff portal children in the correct mode-specific mobile shell: basic, therapist, or driver.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/driver/layout.tsx` - wraps standalone driver routes in `DriverMobileShell` when a staff profile is available.
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/mobile/staff-mobile-bottom-nav.tsx` - now configures the shared floating nav for staff routes.
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/therapist/therapist-mobile-bottom-nav.tsx` - now configures the shared floating nav for therapist routes.
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/driver/driver-mobile-bottom-nav.tsx` - now configures the shared floating nav for staff-portal driver and standalone driver routes while preserving the Profile sheet button.
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/driver/driver-mobile-shell.tsx` - uses the larger shared shell bottom spacing.
- Basic, Therapist, legacy Staff mobile home, and standalone Driver mobile pages - removed duplicate per-page fixed nav renders and old hardcoded `paddingBottom: 96`.

**Behavior:**
- Mobile staff, therapist, and driver workspaces now get one persistent shell-owned floating glass bottom nav.
- Desktop behavior remains unchanged through `md:hidden` nav and `md:contents` shell behavior.
- Staff portal mobile routes preserve existing Basic, Therapist, Driver, mobile week, and mobile schedule component flows.
- Standalone `/driver` and `/driver/dispatch` now share the same mobile driver shell/profile sheet pattern as driver staff portal routes.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS
- `pnpm lint`: PASS (0 errors, 2 existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`)
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 96 routes
- Protected route smoke checks for `/staff-portal`, `/staff-portal/schedule`, `/staff-portal/service-progress`, `/staff-portal/dispatch`, `/driver`, and `/driver/dispatch` reached the local server and redirected unauthenticated traffic to `/login` as expected.

**Follow-up:**
- Authenticated mobile visual QA still needs a valid local staff/therapist/driver session because the current unauthenticated route checks redirect to `/login`.

---

## 2026-06-04 - Codex (DRIVER-TRIPS-MOBILE-001 - Driver Trips mobile page)

**Task:** Build a polished mobile-first Driver Trips page UI for the existing driver trips/dispatch routes, using Trips/Trip/Jobs user-facing naming while keeping internal dispatch route/action names stable.

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/driver/trips/driver-trips-page.tsx` - client Trips page with Today, Upcoming, and History tabs.

- `src/components/features/staff-portal/driver/trips/driver-trip-card.tsx` - reusable trip list card.
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/driver/trips/driver-trip-status-badge.tsx` - Trips-specific status badge labels/styles.
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/driver/trips/driver-trip-empty-state.tsx` - empty states for today/upcoming/history.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/driver/dispatch/page.tsx` - mobile now renders `DriverTripsPage`; desktop keeps `HomeServiceDispatchWorkspace`.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/staff-portal/dispatch/page.tsx` - driver-mode mobile now renders `DriverTripsPage`; desktop/non-driver dispatch behavior is preserved.
- `src/components/features/staff-portal/driver/driver-dispatch-page.tsx` - compatibility wrapper now delegates to `DriverTripsPage` so old visible Dispatch copy is not used.

**Behavior:**
- Driver mobile Trips page shows Today, Upcoming, and History filters.
- Active in-progress trips are promoted into a premium active trip section.
- Upcoming trips and completed/cancelled history use real booking/trip data from existing driver dispatch queries/actions.
- No backend logic, status rules, tables, or desktop dispatch workspace were changed.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm type-check`: PASS
- `pnpm lint`: PASS (0 errors, 2 existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`)
- `pnpm build`: PASS, 96 routes
- `git diff --check`: PASS with LF/CRLF warnings only
- Protected route smoke checks for `/driver/dispatch` and `/staff-portal/dispatch` reached the local server and redirected unauthenticated traffic to `/login` as expected.

**Follow-up:**
- Authenticated mobile visual QA still needs a valid local driver staff session.
