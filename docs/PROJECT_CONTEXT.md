## 🚨 Critical Rules (Summary)

> Full rules in `AGENT_RULES.md` — these are the non-negotiables:

1. **READ `.context/` files BEFORE any work**
2. **UPDATE `.context/` files AFTER any work**
3. **Never skip the checklist** — see AGENT_RULES.md § Pre-Flight
4. **One task at a time** — finish or document why you stopped
5. **No God components** — if a file exceeds 200 lines, refactor
6. **Server Components by default** — only `'use client'` when you need interactivity
7. **Type everything** — no `any`, no implicit types
8. **Test what matters** — business logic, data transforms, edge cases

## Latest Agent Update (2026-05-11)

- Completed `MGR-MOB-001`: added a mobile-first Manager Workspace variant that activates only on mobile breakpoints.
- Desktop `/manager` page preserves the existing `ManagerTodayWorkspace` exactly via responsive `hidden md:block` / `block md:hidden` wrapper.
- Mobile experience includes 5 bottom-nav tabs (Today, Schedule, Bookings, Staff, More) with simplified card-based screens, large touch targets, and spa design tokens.
- Reuses existing data queries (`getTodaysSchedule`, `getDailySchedule`, `getStaffByBranch`, `getPendingStaffByBranch`) without new auth, RLS, or schema changes.
- Verified `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm lint`, and `pnpm build` are passing.

## Latest Agent Update (2026-05-14)

- Completed `NOTIF-001`: added a premium workflow signal foundation with deduped notifications and a new `workflow_tasks` action layer.
- Staff onboarding submission now creates one manager review task and one applicant status update.
- Routine onboarding no longer creates urgent owner notification noise, and CRM receives no HR onboarding notification.
- Manager onboarding review tasks resolve on approval/rejection, and applicant approval/rejection updates are deduped by entity and recipient.
- Verified `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm lint`, and `pnpm build` are passing; lint still reports the two pre-existing onboarding-form warnings.

## Latest Agent Update (2026-05-14)

- Completed `BOOKING-WIZARD-UX-10.2`: public booking wizard service selection is now compact and category-based.
- Active `/book` source path uses the modern Places API (New) widget via `google.maps.importLibrary("places")` and `PlaceAutocompleteElement`; no legacy Places Autocomplete usage remains under `src`.
- Public staff selection now filters to real service-provider staff and respects selected service eligibility mappings; drivers, utility, and non-service staff are hidden from specific provider selection.
- Verified `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm lint`, and `pnpm build` are passing; `/book` returned `200 OK` from the existing local dev server.

## Latest Agent Update (2026-05-15)

- Completed `STAFF-NICKNAME-001`: added nullable `staff.nickname` via migration and updated local Supabase types.
- Owner/manager staff edit forms and staff onboarding now capture optional nicknames without requiring them.
- Public booking and tracking display nickname first for customer recognition; internal manager/CRM/owner/dispatch surfaces show full name plus nickname.
- Staff search now includes nickname in staff management and related schedule/booking filtering.
- Verified `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm lint`, and `pnpm build` are passing; lint still reports the two pre-existing onboarding-form warnings.

## Latest Agent Update (2026-05-15)

- Completed `DISPATCH-LIVE-001`: `/manager/dispatch` now validates the selected date and loads real branch-scoped dispatch data through `getDispatchData()`.
- Active dispatch tabs now render live items, stats, alerts, locations, ETA/location snapshots, and completed/cancelled records instead of mock arrays.
- Removed production dispatch mock data and fake map components, including the unused duplicate prototype dispatch folder.
- Assignment and notification controls are disabled with clear copy until a real selector/action UI is intentionally connected.
- Verified `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm lint`, and `pnpm build` are passing; lint still reports the two pre-existing onboarding-form warnings.

## Latest Agent Update (2026-05-20)

- Completed `BOOKING-MOBILE-SERVICE-GRID-001`: patched the public booking wizard service selection step for compact mobile card grids.
- Mobile service cards now stay inside bounded 2/3/4-column responsive grids with compact image, name, duration, price, and selected state.
- Category chips remain horizontally scrollable only inside their own row, and the public booking shell now clips accidental horizontal overflow.
- Booking data loading, category filtering, selected service logic, provider/date/details flow, desktop layout, and the floating circular widget were preserved.
- Verified `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm lint`, and `pnpm build` are passing; browser smoke checks covered 360px, 390px, 430px, 520px, 768px, and desktop widths with no document-level horizontal overflow.

## Latest Agent Update (2026-05-20)

- Completed `BOOKING-HOME-SERVICES-001`: public booking home-service services now read the same branch-service source of truth used by admin service management.
- Public booking now preserves branch-scoped `available_home_service`, `available_in_spa`, `visibility`, custom price, and custom duration fields, while dropping inactive base services.
- Visibility updates write to the current `branch_services.visibility` column with legacy fallback, and branch-service cache invalidation expires immediately.
- ESLint and Git now ignore `.codex-artifacts/**` so temporary verification artifacts are not scanned or listed as source files.
- No booking UI, step order, provider/date/payment/confirmation behavior, floating widget, hardcoded services, or dummy data was changed.
- Verified `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm lint`, and `pnpm build` are passing; API smoke confirmed 6 Home-eligible public services and 3 non-Home services for the Cradle branch.

## Latest Agent Update (2026-05-20)

- Completed `SCHEDULE-ADJUSTMENT-001`: added manual individual staff availability adjustments inside the existing `/manager/schedule` and `/crm/schedule` Staff view.
- Added shared `adjustStaffScheduleAction` with RBAC, branch-scope checks, target-staff branch validation, date override upsert/delete, blocked-time insert/delete, and route revalidation.
- Added a compact Manual Adjustment section for custom hours, day off, blocked time, clearing overrides, and removing blocks without redesigning the schedule page.
- Daily schedule rows now expose the current date override and real blocked-time IDs so remove actions are precise.
- Existing booking availability/assignment engine was left intact because it already respects `schedule_overrides`, `blocked_times`, weekly `staff_schedules`, and bookings.
- Verified `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm lint`, and `pnpm build` are passing; build renders 83 app routes.

## Latest Agent Update (2026-06-06)

- Completed `PUBLIC-MOBILE-LOADING-TRANSITIONS-001`: public mobile loading now has one short first-homepage intro and one thin warm-gold route-loading line for top-level public page navigation.
- Homepage intro uses `sessionStorage` key `cradle_public_intro_seen`, skips desktop/reduced-motion/repeat sessions, and no longer has a full-screen branded root loading bridge before it.
- Root-mounted route progress is allow-listed to `/`, `/services`, `/book`, `/branches`, `/about`, and `/contact`; booking subroutes/steps, external links, hashes, phone/email links, and protected workspaces are ignored.
- Booking logic, APIs, Supabase/database logic, server actions, protected portals, auth/RBAC, and middleware were not changed.
- Verified `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`, `git diff --check`, and local public route smoke checks are passing; lint still reports two pre-existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`.

## Latest Agent Update (2026-06-06)

- Completed `PUBLIC-BOOKING-MOBILE-VIEWPORT-001`: public mobile `/book` now uses a viewport-fitted wizard shell with compact header/progress, internal active-step scrolling, and fixed bottom actions.
- Mobile Date & Time opens a warm dark bottom sheet for available slots after date selection; selecting a time still updates the existing `selectedSlot` state through the current callback path.
- Services now work inside the constrained mobile shell, with category chips and selected summary compact while the service grid scrolls internally.
- Booking logic, step order, validation, slot fetching/API behavior, submit payloads, Supabase/database logic, server actions, protected portals, auth/RBAC, and desktop layout behavior were not changed.
- Verified `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`, `git diff --check`, `/book` HTTP 200, and headless Chrome mobile screenshots; lint still reports two pre-existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`.

## Latest Agent Update (2026-06-07)

- Completed `PUBLIC-PAGES-DARK-THEME-001`: `/services`, `/contact`, `/about`, and `/branches` now use the dark warm Cradle visual system across mobile page components and desktop public sections.
- Shared `ServiceCatalogClient` now uses dark page surfaces, dark glass category/service cards, muted gold borders/actions, and cream text.
- Shared public `SiteHeader` now stays dark in desktop scrolled mode instead of switching to a cream header.
- Mobile Contact/Branches branch data rows now wrap long names/addresses and keep action labels inside the viewport.
- Booking logic, service/branch data behavior, Supabase/database logic, server actions, protected portals, auth/RBAC, APIs, and backend behavior were not changed.
- Verified `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`, scoped light-surface source scan, production HTTP 200 checks for `/services`, `/contact`, `/about`, `/branches`, and headless Chrome production screenshots; lint still reports two pre-existing warnings in `scripts/generate-service-image-assets.mjs`.

## Latest Agent Update (2026-06-11)

- Completed `UI-MOBILE-PRELOAD-001`: added `MobileFirstVisitPreloader` for the public Cradle experience.
- The preloader is mounted on `/` through `src/app/page.tsx` and on public route-group pages through `src/app/(public)/layout.tsx`.
- It is mobile-only, session-only via `cradle_mobile_preloader_seen`, and uses scoped component keyframes/classes with reduced-motion support.
- The older mobile homepage `CradleBreathReveal` mount was removed so the new preloader is the only public first-visit splash.
- Route progress bars, workspace loaders, skeleton loaders, global loading files, protected portals, booking logic, Supabase/database logic, APIs, server actions, auth/RBAC, and middleware were not changed.
- Verified `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`, `git diff --check`, and headless Chrome runtime checks for mobile first visit, repeat session, desktop skip, protected route skip, public navigation skip, and reduced motion.

## Latest Agent Update (2026-06-11)

- Completed `UI-MOBILE-PRELOAD-002`: fixed the public mobile preloader so no-cookie public responses render overlay markup before client hydration or landing-page animations.
- `/` and the public route-group layout now read `await cookies()` for `cradle_mobile_preloader_seen` and pass `initiallyVisible` to `MobileFirstVisitPreloader`.
- Mobile first visits set both the session cookie and sessionStorage fallback to `1`; repeat-cookie visits skip server markup, desktop visits remove the overlay without setting the cookie, and protected routes do not mount or mark it.
- The preloader now uses the approved dark forest, warm gold, and ivory visual treatment with scoped component CSS and a temporary `.sp-public` animation pause guard while visible.
- Route progress bars, workspace loaders, skeleton loaders, global loading files/CSS, protected portals, booking logic, Supabase/database logic, APIs, server actions, auth/RBAC, and middleware were not changed.
- Verified `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`, `git diff --check`, raw HTML cookie/no-cookie behavior, and headless Chrome CDP checks for mobile first paint, fade removal, repeat-cookie skip, desktop no-cookie skip, and protected-route isolation.

## Latest Agent Update (2026-06-11)

- Completed `CRM-SCHEDULE-UI-001`: CRM Schedule Daily Timeline now defaults to Fit Day mode so the full active day fits inside the main schedule column while the right rail remains visible.
- Added an Expand/Collapse control beside the density controls; Expanded mode hides the CRM right rail and gives the timeline full page width with horizontal scrolling for detail inspection.
- Timeline range is calculated from staff work hours, current overrides, bookings, and blocked times, with an 8 AM to 11 PM fallback when no active data is available.
- Booking blocks, blocked-time blocks, off-duty overlays, grid lines, hour labels, and the current-time marker now share percent-based full-day positioning.
- Public mobile preloader, public landing page, booking logic, schedule generation logic, Supabase schema/database logic, workspace loaders, and skeleton loaders were not changed.
- Verified `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`, `git diff --check`, and a local unauthenticated `/crm/schedule` route probe returning `307 /login`; authenticated visual QA still needs a logged-in CRM session.

## Latest Agent Update (2026-06-15)

- Completed `OWNER-RECONNECT-001`: restored the existing Owner workspace for authorized owner users.
- `/owner` now uses an Owner workspace guard instead of the old soft-pause redirect to `/crm`, while Manager remains soft-paused to CRM.
- Owner role/default navigation now resolves to `/owner`; Owner nav is visible again and no longer exposes `/dev`.
- Owner prefetch no longer warms stale `/owner/settings` or `/dev` routes.
- No Supabase schema, RLS, migration, CRM workflow, Staff Portal, Driver Portal, public booking, scheduling, dispatch, or payroll business logic changes were made.
- Verified `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm lint`, focused Owner workspace tests, production `pnpm build`, service-role/RLS/stale-route scans; full `pnpm test` still has two unrelated booking progress failures.

## Latest Agent Update (2026-06-15)

- Completed `OWNER-DASHBOARD-REDESIGN-001`: rebuilt `/owner` Overview to match the approved Owner Dashboard reference inside the existing Owner shell.
- Added a server-side Owner dashboard loader with real bookings, branches, staff, schedules/check-ins, notifications, workflow tasks, and fixed-monthly payroll data.
- Dashboard sections now show partial error states instead of silently converting failed queries to zero metrics.
- Added pure dashboard business-rule helpers and 13 focused Vitest tests for bookings, completed sessions, paid revenue, active branches/staff, action counts, branch normalization, payroll totals, staff on-shift, auth access, empty data, missing payroll setup, and partial failures.
- No Supabase schema, RLS, migration, global shell, CRM workflow, Staff Portal, Driver Portal, public booking, booking progress, or schedule engine changes were made for the dashboard.
- Verified `pnpm test tests/lib/owner/dashboard.test.ts`, `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`, and unauthenticated `/owner -> /login` browser smoke; full `pnpm test` still has two unrelated booking progress failures.

## Latest Agent Update (2026-06-17)

- Completed `CRM-INDIVIDUAL-SCHEDULE-LIVE-SYNC-001`: CRM individual staff schedule saves now verify Supabase returned rows from `staff_schedules` before reporting success.
- Added a shared effective schedule resolver using priority: date day-off override, date custom override, individual weekly schedule, staff-group fallback, then unscheduled.
- Live Staff now reads resolved `schedule_windows` from the daily schedule query instead of combining an aggregated daily span with a separate raw active `staff_schedules` query.
- Multiple shift windows now display in the Live Staff Staff List as `2 shifts` with each opening/closing time range.
- A saved inactive individual weekly row is treated as an individual day off and no longer falls through to group fallback in Live Staff or booking availability post-filter.
- `/api/crm/availability` and the CRM Live Availability SWR fetch no longer retain short stale cached responses after schedule saves.
- Existing RLS/grants were verified for CRM/CSR operational SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE on `staff_schedules`; no new migration was needed because this upsert flow does not require DELETE.
- Verified `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`, and the requested swallowed-error scan; authenticated CRM click-through remains a manual QA step.

## Latest Agent Update (2026-06-17)

- Completed `AUTH-RESET-SUPABASE-CONNECTION-001`: self-service and Owner-triggered password recovery now build Supabase reset links from trusted `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` and land on `/reset-password`.
- Production reset links reject localhost app URLs; local development still falls back to `http://localhost:3000/reset-password`.
- `/reset-password` forwards Supabase recovery `code` or `token_hash` params to `/auth/callback`, which exchanges/verifies the recovery session, sanitizes the next path, and marks the recovery session before the password form renders.
- Password updates require the recovery marker and current Supabase user, apply shared password policy rules, call `auth.updateUser({ password })`, sign out, and return to `/login?passwordUpdated=true`.
- `/login` shows the reset affordance as `Forgot password?` beside the Password label and now displays a post-reset confirmation banner.
- Supabase dashboard follow-up: set Site URL to `https://cradlewellnessliving.com`, add redirect URLs for `http://localhost:3000/reset-password` and `https://cradlewellnessliving.com/reset-password`, and replace any Vercel placeholder with the real deployment URL.
- Verified `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, focused auth tests, and requested unsafe scans; only the existing server-only Supabase admin client references `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.
