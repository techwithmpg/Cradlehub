## Authority order

1. Latest explicit owner instruction
2. Active decisions in [docs/11-DECISION-LOG.md](docs/11-DECISION-LOG.md)
3. This file
4. Frozen stabilization/product scope
5. Current project/stage status
6. Relevant active architecture, safety, UI, and testing governance
7. Accepted implementation
8. Production state independently proven by authorized evidence

## Hard safety state

- `main` is production-connected; an accepted merge or push can deploy.
- Production data, schema, Auth, RLS, Storage, and secrets require explicit target-aware authorization.
- Eighty-four historical local-only migration versions must not be bulk replayed, marked applied, or pushed merely to normalize history.
- Attendance scanning and operational enforcement are separate controls. Operational enforcement remains not training-ready until its recorded gates pass.

## Current authorization

C0B, C1, C2, and C3 are closed and accepted. C3 Scope Freeze for the Digital Marketing Workspace was merged into main at `d19ce34753e09244b8aad0e1d10c964302a33e7c`. C4 UI/UX and Workflow Planning is ACTIVE for the frozen Digital Marketing Workspace scope only (Website, Brand, Branches, Services, Media Library, with Drafts and Settings secondary, and contextual SEO). C4 is design, workflow, and specification planning only. C4 does NOT authorize product implementation, schema/database changes, migrations, RLS changes, Storage changes, Auth changes, production mutation, or C5+ coding.

## Historical context policy

`.context/` and older duplicated task, handoff, decision, error, roadmap, and status material remain historical evidence. They are not active governance after C0B.
